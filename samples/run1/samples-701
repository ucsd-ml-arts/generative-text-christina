 more to think about?
Chandler: Well, that’s the best gift we have! (He gives it to Monica, and
Monica ignores it.)
Joey: But.. But, (hands him the gift) it’s a fake.
(Chandler looks extremely frightened.)
Monica: You know what it’s worth, you are, you are the best roommate on
the planet!
Chandler: It’s not worth $100 million that you agreed to move in with a
little girl who looks like, from New York City.
Monica: (moved) Yeah, but this place is sooo much nicer than my place, you
dont even have to tell anyone you love where you live!
Chandler: (laughing) You make my point. (She leaves.)
(After Joey leaves, he turns and walks back in and sees Phoebe standing there.)
Joey: Pheebs?
Phoebe: Oh my God, Joey! Hey, what is going on here?
Joey: Well, what is it?
Phoebe: I just talked to Rachel, y’know about the gift!
Joey: What?
Phoebe: We brought a card that allows us to rent movies to all our friends.
What is this? A card?!
Joey: (shyly) I don’t know!! But you brought back… (He shakes his
apiece of remembrance.)
Monica: (seeing the gesture) Oh yes you brought it!
Phoebe: And now you’re bringing back a new movie, it’s gonna cost you
hundreds of dollars.
Joey: Okay, okay, see, it’s an awesome gift, it’s been around forever, and
you are the best roommate on earth! But, y’know what? You don’t have to pay for it.
You can buy one all you want in this big apartment all right! It doesn’t cost a penny to get
the award! There’s no real cost to living, just a great gift!
Monica: Joey, you can get this right now; the apartment is free! (Joey smiles
livelyly.) But, if you cancel the offer you can’t afford the rent, and you can
get the award right here! (Joey smiles knowing his mother will be looking at him.)

pilots are there but are non-functional.]
Ross: (entering) Here I am!

Bernice: Hi.
Ross: Hi. Are you in there somewhere?
Bernice: I just moved in, I work in fashion.
Ross: Oh I see.
Bernice: Oh hey, can I see you at work?
Ross: Yeah, yeah I do.
Bernice: Y’know you should've called me.
Ross: Oh yeah, I guess I will. I’ll call you later.
Bernice: I know. I am so glad you called.
Ross: Oh wow, my heart doesn’t…stop growing.
Bernice: Ahh, so we are great! We make such a bond!
Ross: Oh no!! I thought we, we were, we’d be happy to give you
a ride, you know? You’d never know what you’re bringing with you!
Bernice: Oh my God, you can’t keep it up.
Ross: Look, we’re not in this together.
[Scene: The hallway between Chandler and Monica, he is getting ready to go to work.]
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Chandler! I’m so glad you called! You brought me a present! (She holds her hand
and starts to cry.) It’s been forever! And I can’t wait to take it back!
Monica: It’s just that I-it’s expensive, and I can’t, I can’t
want to see you when my daughter goes to the theatre, you know? And I don’t think that
is right for you.
Chandler: I want it! Thank you!
Monica: You got it?! You got it?!
Chandler: I-I got it! (They hug.)
Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! (She kisses him on the cheek and kisses him on the
mouth. Then kisses him back too.)
Monica: Oh that�
