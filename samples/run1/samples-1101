======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you are afraid of, you'll never know
what you're gonna get.

MRS GREEN: What?

RTST: Sex Worker 2. [Ross leaves.]

MONICA: Well, is the lighting the correct?

MRS GREEN: That depends on how much you want it. [reading the manual] In my day, if you wanted to
light a lamp in my apartment, you'd have to beat the crap out of it at the Grand Opera
tonight.

RTST: What is the most ironic thing you can think of, Ross?

MONICA: I mean in-in the middle of a passion.

[Ross walks by and pulls out a bookcase.]

RTST: This could be one of those things where you give and you get
noticed. Oh, you have to be really sad when you don't get this done, because you're
going to have so many women on your stage, everybody's saying "I can't do this" and
you'll see them and you know it's time to move on.

MONICA: You have three options, you can try to kill it off, or you can keep it at the
front.

[Scene: The Moondance Diner. Joey, Rachel, and Monica are trading blows.]

MRS GREEN: There is no way I could not want this done right. [Rachel holds the cards in her
hands and bites back the card that is causing the blow.]

PHOEBE: [opens the gift] What are you guys looking at? Look at this!

JOEY: Oh, what is that? Look at that!

MRS GREEN: [pulls the card out of the box] This is from Ursula, daughter of Macon.

JOEY: That's a really hot card.

MRS GREEN: This is from you? Hey Bing, if you get this from me, I'll send you as much as I
get's Ursula gets.

JOEY: It's not a hot card, it's only a tray. No, let's see, instead we'll put the gift
in our apartment's basement.

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Janice lying in bed.]

CHANDLER: I hate this all. I cannot live off the gift. Oh come on. There's just too much
place into this. [gets up and opens the gifts] Here come these (gives a gift to him) uh, pretty
sets, comfy, yummy. Okay, I've heard you were open about your apartment, about
everything, uh-hmm.

JOEY: So what are you gonna do?

CHANDLER: I don't know. What I am gonna do, I'm gonna break your apartment down.

JOEY: Is this gonna be easy?

CHANDLER: Yeah, except I think that breaking down these [cheekily give each other a chance and stare] apartment
carts is actually a good idea.

JOEY: Huh.

CHANDLER: [gets up and raises an eyebrow] Yeah. [shows him the apartment]

JOEY: So what'd you think, 'One of those downstairs?', 'One upstairs' or 'One down' or
'One in a row' or 'One in the pooper'?

CHANDLER: That's going to be a long walk.

JOEY: Oh come on buddy, stop this womanising.

CHANDLER: So who's to say what could you do for a living?

JOEY: I don't know. It's nice to know someone, I just have, I just have to break
down something that I already have (a gift, a gift, something) and move on. What do you got?

CHANDLER: Huh?

JOEY: No, uh, but uh, but you have to tell me something.

CHANDLER: Alright, listen, this is for you. I'm sorry I'm late. I was just at the bathroom
and there was-was a woman at the bath tub, uh, so obviously there's something you
wanna be at the party, just tell her.

JOEY: OKyy.

CHANDLER: Alright. So um what do you want me to tell her?

[Ross enters.]

ROSS: Hey guys.

ALL: Hey.

PHOEBE: Hey.

JOEY: Uh, Ross, can I ask you guys something? [pause] Do you guys ever get asked this
kind of stuff?

ROSS: Uh yes.

MONICA: Uh-huh, yeah.

ROSS: Monica
