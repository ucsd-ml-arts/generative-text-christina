 say. How does that make you feel?
Phoebe: I don’t know, but sometimes you just have to think about it. I mean, I’m
just so close to you that maybe we can…
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe sit on the couch.]
Rachel: Yay-ay-ay-ay….
Phoebe: Hey, don’t-don’t feel anything. (She sits down) Okay.
Rachel: I think it looks like you’ll see me naked on the street. And so I guess what
you’re going through is my uh, my friend’s.
Phoebe: Okay. So would you like to get in touch?
Rachel: Uh, sure.
Phoebe: Okay. Good luck.
Rachel: (She hesitates) Okay. Ok. I’ll be out here with your new friend
Phoebe.
Phoebe: Oh, no problem.
Rachel: Oh? Then what do you want to do?
Phoebe: Well, I think I want to see you naked.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: You think I want to see what you actually have in your butt?
Rachel: I’m fine with nakedness.
Phoebe: Then you say what you want.
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: I think you’re going to say what you want.
Rachel: Yeah, yeah-yeah. Uh-huh, well…
Phoebe: What do you say?
Rachel: That you want me to have naked…
Phoebe: Huh? What?! I just said what I said. Hey-hey, come on, Monica.
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make your life more difficult.
Rachel: Oh good.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: Yay, yay!
Phoebe: Well, look at you. (She leans into Rachel and they hug.)
Rachel: Are you sure?
Phoebe: (grunting) No.
Rachel: Yay.
Phoebe: Yeah and then-then, you go back upstairs and we go again.
Rachel: Oh, my God!
Phoebe: (pinches her butt with her spoon) Oh, honey, can you believe that?! We are
doing that to you again?
Rachel: Oh…
Phoebe: Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry. It’s just something you
can do now that I don’t mind having it.
Rachel: (in a serious voice, whoopee) Yeah.
Phoebe: Yay!
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: I really hope you’re going to like this.
Rachel: Yay! Good luck Monica. (She climbs inside and pulls out a naked man.)
Ross: Okay, I’m sorry, but Ross, I did it again!
Rachel: Yes!
Ross: (looking in Monica’s room) Yay!
Rachel: (smooching) So did it stop raining?
Ross: No, not really, but oh!
Rachel: Oh that’s great! So how was your date?
Ross: Uh-huh I went for a swim.
Rachel: Uh-huh! I went for a swim huh?
Ross: Uh-huh! Uh-huh huh? Uh-huh huh? (Rachel turns around and goes to pick up a piece of
her friend’s shirt and falls down.)
Rachel: Oh no! I-I just realized that if I did that again I’d be in
exile state.
Ross: Well if you ever pee in your underwear and you’re a sailor, y’know, then
I’ll uh—Oh that’s okay. Okay Ross we understand.
Rachel: Oh?
Ross: Oh, you’re not having sex anymore?
Rachel: (stopping suddenly) No!! No!! No!!
Ross: (notices) Are you having sex?
Rachel: Uh-uh sure! I feel like I’m gonna be in a lot of places that…that
I should never, never, never go to again.
Ross: You know what? I would never do anything to you, or anybody else, or
my friends’s friends’s friends’s friends’s friends’s
friends’s friends’s friends’s friends’s friends’s butt, my friends’s
butt, my buddies’ butt,
