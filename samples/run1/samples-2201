—and so it's fine. I mean, I got an OK with this guy, but is he really
great?
Rachel: Oh my God, is he fat?
Ross: Oh-oh-oh, no-no...no. I mean, like, y'know, he doesn't eat (Points up
to Phoebe) all that much food because I pall around in my chair because it’s
fat.
Rachel: (points to herself) Big deal. Why-why does my chair always have so much food? 
Ross: Well...last night, I uh, uh had, like four bowls of soup.
Rachel: Okay, y'know what. This is your pot.
Ross: Mm-hmm.
Rachel: Okay, so this is your pot.
Ross: Hmm.
Rachel: But, y'know, this is your bath. And, y'know, I don’t wanna start have
two cups of absolutely nothing.
Ross: I know. I know.
Rachel: Okay. (We hear the shut off of the toilet.) Okay, um, we should stop
for today.
Ross: Oh, hey, hey, I’ll see ya. (Hugs him. Then walks back to couch.)
(Just as he exits, Phoebe has returned with two more pots. Rachel starts to clean them off.)
Rachel: Oh, hi!
(After sheoshers him out)
[Scene: Las Vegas, we have the 8-bit game show, Hotel Monica. We start out the
show, which probably shouldn’t be called a show. It’s just that, it’s
a whole group of people, (notices) and- (notices) and… (pause) What the
Bengals?
Monica: Oh, this is it. 
Bengals. 
Monica: This is where I keep the uh, my savings. 
Chandler: (dejected) Hi!
Monica: I guess you’re not finished yet.
Chandler: Oh, it’s uh, probably just finishing.
Monica: (still isn’t done with work) Okay, I guess we should start playing 'The
Bluff'.
Chandler: Oh, that’s beautiful. (He gets up to leave.)
Monica: Oh, my God. (She runs over and hugs him. Chandler tries to steal some
again, catches him with his fall. Monica looks for some cushion, but doesn’t see one.]
Chandler: So ah, Monica, that uh, that chandelier? Why don’t you go get it,
because it cost thirty bucks?
Monica: Forget it, forget it. It’s no big deal.
Chandler: Well, it’s around the corner, maybe you can find it.
Monica: All right, come on, I just need a little time.
Chandler: Okay. (He goes to get some money from Monica and goes to that big table.)
Monica: And where is this other stuff?
Chandler: In the bedroom.
Monica: Okay, maybe that’s a good idea.
Chandler: Oh, is it, in that order?
Monica: All right, here we go. (She returns to the couch.)
Chandler: You okay?
Monica: Yeah, I’m fine. Stood her up, and me, and you, and you didn’t fight
at all before, so why would I fight at all?
Chandler: Well, now—well, come here.
Monica: No, come here.
Chandler: You?
Monica: Yeah.
Chandler: Hi.
Monica: What?
Chandler: My jewelry!
Monica: Yeah. What—who jewelry?
Chandler: It’s—it’s decorated.
Monica: But didn’t you fight back?
Chandler: Okay, yeah, I did. But to you, it’s like, it’s so
we’re, we can’t do that. I don’t know, it’s just, you know, it’s
soakable! I love you, and I love you so much!
Monica: (starts to cry) I almost cried; and sometimes when I’m in love with a
man…
Chandler: When did you say that?
Monica: Okay, Chandler, when we were together.
Chandler: I dunno what time
