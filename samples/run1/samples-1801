get-get yourself a soda.

 RACHEL: Well, I was gonna say the phrase when you broke up with
me, but I heard you were having none of that fun right now. I'm sorry.

bad fun and I... have a big stupid penis.

RACHEL: So, what's going on now?

ROSS: Well, I don't know what's going on with you and Kathy but, I

RACHEL: Oh yeah, well, y'know, the funny ones were your share.

ROSS: Thanks, doo.
