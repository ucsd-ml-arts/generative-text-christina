# Project 1 Generative Text

Christina Ho, cgh003@ucsd.edu

## Abstract

*Friends* is an iconic show from the 90s that ran for over 10 years. Ever since it ended, the show has had a huge influence on pop culture and many fans of the show have called for a reboot or a reunion of the cast. For this project, we are going to use ML to attempt to create a scene with the same lovable elements of the show. We will use an RNN model to train on all the scripts of *Friends* from the internet. Then the training parameters will be changed to generate a script that makes sense.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). https://fangj.github.io/friends/

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
