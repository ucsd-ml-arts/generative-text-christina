[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]
Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!
Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!
Chandler: All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?
(They all stare, bemused.)
Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!
Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.
[Time Lapse]
Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there.
Joey: Instead of...?
Chandler: That's right.
Joey: Never had that dream.
Phoebe: No.
Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. 
Monica: And they weren't looking at
you before?!
Chandler: Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]
Ross: (mortified) Hi.
Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?
Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck...
Chandler: Cookie?
Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. 
Joey: Ohh.
Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
Ross: Thanks.
Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)
Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?
Phoebe: Fine!  Be murky!
Ross: I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Monica: No you don't.
Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
Ross: I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well.
Monica: Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have
grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?
Ross: Sorry.
Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
(Ross gestures his consent.)
Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!
(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search
the room.)
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)
Monica: Rachel?!
Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!
Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?
Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? 
Rachel: Hi, sure!
Ross: Hi. 
(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens.  He sits
back down defeated again.  A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others
expect her to explain.)
Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?
Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked
familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I
doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where
to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I
knew who lived here in the city.
Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV
and are trying to figure out what is going on.]
Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. 
Chandler: (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
Ross: (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having.
Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! 
(The scene on TV has changed to show two
women, one is holding her hair.)
Phoebe:  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. 
Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. 
Joey: I say push her down the stairs. 
Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey: 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)
Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. 
Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica...
Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]
Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things...
Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few...
Rachel: I'm all better now.
Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing.
Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!
Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?
(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)
Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound.
Paul: (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul.
Monica: Oh God, is it
6:30?  Buzz him in!
Joey: Who's Paul?
Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real
date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Ross: He finally asked you out?
Monica: Yes!
Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Monica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?
Ross: (choked voice) That'd be good...
Monica: (horrified) Really?
Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!
Phoebe: What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)
(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)
Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?
Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Ross: A wandering?
Monica: Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.
Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good.
(Monica goes to change.)
Joey:  Hey, Paul!
Paul: Yeah?
Joey: Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red.
Monica: (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!
Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?
Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. 
Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.
Ross: Okay, sure.
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Commercial Break
[Scene: The Subway, Phoebe is singing for
change.]
Phoebe: (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
[Scene: Ross's Apartment, the guys are there assembling
furniture.]
Ross: (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
(Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling
the bookcase.)
Joey: I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here.
Chandler: It's a beautiful thing.
Joey: (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
Chandler: I would have to
say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Joey: Which goes where?
Chandler: I have no
idea.
(Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a
plant.)
Joey: Done with the bookcase!
Chandler: All finished!
Ross: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Chandler: Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun.
Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Ross: You guys.
Chandler: Oh, God.
Joey: You got screwed.
Chandler: Oh my God!
[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating.]
Monica: Oh my God!
Paul: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?
Monica: My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Paul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-
Monica: -leg?
Paul: (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch.
Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.
Monica: That's right.
[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]
Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
[Scene: Ross's Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and
Chandler are working on some more furniture.]
Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!
Joey: Shut up!
Chandler: You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
Ross: That only took me an hour.
Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Chandler: Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A
Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]
Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?
Paul: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation.
Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Paul: Isn't there?
Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?
Paul: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. 
Monica: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Paul: It's okay...
Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?
Paul: Two years.
Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!

Paul: So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?
Monica: (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is watching Joanne
Loves Chaci.]
Priest on TV:
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and
Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!
[Scene: Ross's Apartment, they're all sitting around and
talking.]
Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? 
Joey: Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
Chandler: Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats.
Joey: Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)
Ross: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)
[Cut to Rachel staring out of her window.]
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is making coffee for
Joey and Chandler.]
Rachel: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life.
Chandler: That is amazing.
Joey: Congratulations. 
Rachel: Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Chandler: If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do.
Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry...
Monica: (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
All: Morning. Good morning.
Paul: (entering from Monica's room)
Morning.
Joey: Morning, Paul.
Rachel: Hello, Paul.
Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?
(Monica and Paul walk to the door and talk in a low voice
so the others can't hear.  The others move Monica's table closer to the door so that
they can.)
Paul: Thank you!  Thank you so
much!
Monica: Stop!
Paul: No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Monica: We'll talk later.
Paul: Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?
Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.
All: Okayyy! (They do so.)
Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... 
Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff.
Joey: Yeah, I'm an actor.
Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Joey: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park.
Joey: Look, it was a job all right?
Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Joey: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)
Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Joey: You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) 
Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth.
Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?
Rachel: Oh, yeah.
Monica: Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Rachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Monica: Big time!
Rachel: Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used.
Monica: I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Rachel: Oh, look, wish me luck!
Monica: What for?
Rachel: I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things.
(Monica exits.)
[Scene: Iridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters.] 
Frannie: Hey, Monica! 
Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? 
Frannie: You had sex, didn't you? 
Monica: How do you do that?
Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through
Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who? 
Monica: You know Paul? 
Frannie: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. 
Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? 
Frannie: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no
snap in his turtle for two years. 
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
Joey: (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line! 
Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? 
Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you
into bed'. 
Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!
Phoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe.
Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
Phoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.) 
Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know? 
Joey: (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!

(Monica pushes him off of the sofa as Rachel enters with a shopping bag.) 
Rachel: Guess what? 
Ross: You got a job? 
Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve
interviews today. 
Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty
percent off! 
Chandler: Oh, how well you know me... 
Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got
great boots' boots! 
Monica: How'd you pay for them? 
Rachel: Uh, credit card. 
Monica: And who pays for that? 
Rachel: Um... my... father. 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table.  
Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]
Rachel: Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. 
Monica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. 
Rachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married. 
Phoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. 
Rachel: Thank you. 
Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was
fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got
here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,
cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. 
(Pause) 
Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... 
Monica: All right, you ready?
Rachel: No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!
Monica: You can, I know you
can! 
Rachel: I don't think so.
Ross: Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
Ross: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... 
All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)
Rachel: Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Monica:  Rachel! 
That was a library card! 
All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Chandler: (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. 
(She finishes cutting them up and they all
cheer.)
Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! 
[Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it's broadcast day by
playing the national anthem.] 
Monica: Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? 
Ross: No. No, I gotta go home sometime. 
Monica: You be okay? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? 
Monica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.
Alright. Goodnight, everybody. 
Ross and Rachel: Goodnight.
(Monica stomps on Paul's watch and goes into her room.)
Ross: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- 
Rachel: Sorry- 
Ross: No no no, go- 
Rachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it- 
Ross: Split it? 
Rachel: Okay. 
Ross: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in
high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. 
Rachel: I knew. 
Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother. 
Rachel: I did. 
Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Sometime? Maybe? 
Rachel: Yeah, maybe... 
Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will... 
Rachel: Goodnight. 
Ross: Goodnight. 
(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.) 
Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? 
Ross: I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that
means.) 
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.] 
Joey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here. 
Phoebe: (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here... 
Monica: What? I-I said you had a- 
Phoebe: (sings) What I said you had... 
Monica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop? 
Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?
All: Yes!
Monica: I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt.
Joey: Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya.
Ross: There's an image.

Rachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? 
Chandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it? 
Rachel: I'm just serving it. 
All: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee. 
Chandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel
sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
Customer: (To
Rachel) Ahh, miss?   More coffee? 
Rachel: Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give
this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank
you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.
Chandler: Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- 
End[Scene Central Perk, everyone's there.]
Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? 
Phoebe: Oh, yeah! 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,
y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd
comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...
that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great
the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're
in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time
you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Opening Credits
[Scene: Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker
(Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.] 
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little
angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits
at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that
glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
(Carol, Ross's ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.) 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in
the Ice Age. 
(Marsha extis and Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.) 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,
uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching Three's
Company.]
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I
realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)
...now I wish I was dead. 
(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.) 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already
fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition
than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a
child's pillow. 
Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're
like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every
time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.
Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
All: Eeaagh! 
(Rachel enters from her room.) 
Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
Phoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful. 
Rachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under
the couch cushions.) 
Phoebe: No, look, don't touch that! 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to
him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front
of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the
ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the
kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of
the glass pan.) 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring
in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there's a knock on the
door which Monica answers.) 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about
now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not
comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them
tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.) 
Joey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
[Scene, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their
parents.] 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack)
Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mr. Geller: (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for
you, didn't she? 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,
or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same
pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you
planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some
of the heat off me. 
[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.] 
Mrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the
club, they were not playing very well. 
Mr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty
thousand dollars is a lot of money! 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have
been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were
just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... 
[Time Lapse.]
Mr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. 
[Time Lapse.] 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank
God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on
with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to
share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise
you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,
here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant
with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
(Stunned silence ensues.) 
Mrs. Geller: (To Monica) And you knew about this?! 
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Park, everyone's there.] 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they
take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you
could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Phoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. 
Rachel: You're twins? 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Phoebe: She's a waitress. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to
leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents
actually preferred. 
Rachel: The lights, please..
(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up.  Ross
enters from the bathroom.) 
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry
tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's
gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too
terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give
Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-
and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his
hand.) 
[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.] 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big
dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
(Susan enters holding a drink.) 
Susan: Hi. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,
uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Carol: Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.) 
[Scene Barry's office, Barry is working on patient, Robbie, as Rachel enters.] 
Rachel: Barry? 
Barry: C'mon in. 
Rachel: (hesitates) Are you sure? 
Barry: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours. 
Robbie: Huh?! 
Barry: So, how ya doin? 
Rachel: I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great! 
Barry: Yeah, well.. 
Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging. 
Barry: (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back
in a sec. 
(As Barry exits Robbie stares at Rachel.) 
Rachel: I dumped him. 
Robbie: Okay. 
[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, they're talking about how this is going to work.] 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know,
when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the
baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about
Julia? 
Carol: Julia.. 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together.
Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
[Scene: Barry's office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry's lamp as
Barry enters.] 
Barry: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? 
Rachel: Oh, not much. I-I got a job. 
Barry: Oh, that's great. 
Rachel: Why are- why are you so tanned? 
Barry: Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba. 
Rachel: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? 
Barry: No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt. 
Robbie: Me?! 
Barry: No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy. 
Rachel: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! 
Barry: Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. 
Rachel: Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs! 
Barry: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet. 
Rachel: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! 
Barry: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. 
Rachel: Okay.. 
Barry: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted
to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. 
Rachel: Wow. 
Barry: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't
happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. 
Rachel: What? 
Robbie: Me. (Spits.) 
Rachel: Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to
you. And thank you for giving it to me. 
Barry: Well, thank you for giving it back. 
(Barry and Rachel look at each other.) 
Robbie: Hello?! 
[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, they're still arguing about what to name the baby.] 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Susan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I
think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say
all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever
imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is
too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? 
All: Yeah. Yeah. A little. 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for
sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be
involved in this particular thing right now. 
(He turns to go, but the sound of the sonogram catches hes ear.  He returns and
stares at it.)
Ross: Oh my God. 
Susan: Look at that. 
Carol: I know. 
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram.
  Rachel is on the phone.]
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it
kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up! 
Rachel: (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry
today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I
really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up
getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline
and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now. 
End[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.] 
Phoebe: (entering) Hi guys! 
All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi! 
Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? 
Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this
again!' 
All: Ohh. Ouch. 
Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will
never see me naked'. 
Rachel: Since when? 
Joey: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means
'It is you'. 
Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing
alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
Phoebe: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,
I already am'. 
Rachel: And everybody knows this? 
Joey: Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
Chandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to
sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send
our dog off to live on a farm. 
Monica: Uh, Ross. 
Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-
it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! 
Opening Credits 
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is helping Joey rehearse for a part.]
Chandler: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
Joey: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to
live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
Chandler: Hey, that was really good! 
Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going. 
Chandler: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" 
Joey: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can
smoke." 
Chandler: "Smoke away." 
(Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.  He fumbles and drops the
lighter.  Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)
Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. 
Joey: What? 
Chandler: Relax your hand! 
(Joey lets his wrist go limp.) 
Chandler: Not so much! 
Joey: Whoah! 
Chandler: Hey! 
Joey: Hey! 
Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff. 
(Joey tries and visibly winces.) 
Chandler: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. 
Joey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. 
Chandler: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. 
(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.) 
Chandler: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been
missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. 
Joey: Y'miss it? 
Chandler: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..
God. (He continues to smoke.) 
[Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.] 
Monica: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a
guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. 
(The guys stretch out their fingers.) 
Joey: That's ridiculous! 
Ross: Can I use.. either thumb? 
Rachel: (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced
tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! 
All: Yeah. Yeah, excellent. 
Rachel: (leaving to serve others) Good for me! 
(The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters.  She sits
down without saying hi.)
Joey: Y'okay, Phoebe? 
Phoebe: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. 
Monica: What did they do to you? 
Phoebe: It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up
their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- 
Ross: Easy. 
Phoebe: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again... 
Phoebe: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. 
Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it! 
Phoebe: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like
stealing. 
Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 
Phoebe: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know
what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was
happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,
not-not-mine'... 
Monica: We're with you. We got it. 
(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.) 
Phoebe: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this
giant karmic debt. 
Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing? 
Monica: (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing? 
(Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of
smoke.)
All: Oh! Oh, God! 
Ross: What is this?! 
Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. 
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
Chandler: And this- is my reward! 
Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last
time you quit. 
Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit! 
All: Ohhh! Put it out! 
Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in
Phoebe's coffee.) 
Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! 
Monica: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. 
Rachel: This Alan again? How's it goin'? 
Monica: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. 
Joey: So when do we get to meet the guy? 
Monica: Let's see, today's Monday... Never. 
All: Oh, come on! Come on! 
Monica: No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..
Sorry. 
Monica: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance
to figure that out. 
Rachel: Well, then can we meet him? 
Monica: Nope. Schhorry. 
[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]
Monica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and
within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the
weak members of the herd. 
Paula: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll
tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just
looking out after you. 
Monica: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually
liked. 
Paula: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if
they never get to meet the guy.. 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.]
Joey: Let it go, Ross. 
Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. 
Monica: Do you all promise? 
All: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! 
Monica: (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
(Chandler makes a 'Cross my heart' sign.  It starts to rain and he taps on the
window.)
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! 
(Chandler sulkilty picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)
(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without
saying hi.)
Ross: Hey, Pheebs. 
Phoebe: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have
credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and
hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 
Rachel: What bank is this? 
(The intercom buzzes.) 
Monica: Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it? 
Alan: (on the intercom) It's Alan. 
Joey: (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here! 
(Chandler comes in, dripping wet.) 
Monica: (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you
all like me. 
(She opens the door and Alan enters.) 
Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. 
Alan: Hi. 
All: Hi, Alan. 
Alan: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! 
(Everyone laughs.)
[Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]
Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? 
(Silence.) 
Monica: C'mon! 
Ross: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I
can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. 
All: Loved him! Yeah! He's great! 
Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out
with? 
All: Yeah! 
Rachel: And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) 
The Guys: (reluctantly) Yeah. 
Joey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! 
Ross: ...What shoe? 
Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked
smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' 
(Dubious pause.) 
Ross: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future
boyfriends will be measured. 
Rachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. 
Monica: Really! 
Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.
You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression) 
Ross: You know what I like most about him, though? 
All: What? 
Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself. 
All: Yeah... 
Commercial Break 
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is alone as Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey enter
dejectedly in softball gear.] 
Monica: Hi.. how was the game? 
Ross: Well.. 
All: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! 
Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? 
Joey: Alan. 
Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where
Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-... 
Rachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about
softball.. 
Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..
sometimes.. 
Ross: What? 
Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan? 
Rachel: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. 
Ross: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan. 
[Scene: A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.] 
Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie. 
Lizzie: Hey, Weird Girl. 
Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup. 
Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels? 
Phoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh,
I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) 
Lizzie: Saltines? 
Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 
Lizzie: What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's
really money in here. 
Phoebe: I know. 
Lizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing? 
Phoebe: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. 
Lizzie: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something. 
Phoebe: Oh, that's fine, no. 
Lizzie: Would you like my tin-foil hat? 
Phoebe: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. 
Lizzie: Please, let me do something. 
Phoebe: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? 
Lizzie: Okay. 
Phoebe: Okay. 
[Scene: Chandler's office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff
of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  He
types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.
  While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a
squirt of air freshener and gags.]
[Scene: A Street, Phoebe and Lizzie are at a hot dog vendor.]
Lizzie: Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
Phoebe: No, I'm fine. 
Lizzie: (leaves) See ya. 
(Phoebe opens the can and reacts.) 
Phoebe: Huh! 
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]
Ross: A thumb?! 
(Phoebe nods.) 
All: Eww! 
Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? 
Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see? 
All: Nooo! 
(Chandler lights a cigarette.)
All: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! 
Rachel: It's worse than the thumb! 
Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair! 
Monica: Oh, why is it unfair? 
Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with
that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those
flaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
(An awkward silence ensues.)
Joey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
Rachel: Well, I-I could live without it. 
Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her
hair? 
(Phoebe spits out her hair.)
Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. 
Joey: Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"? 
(Monica laughs and snorts.) 
Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
Rachel: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. 
Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 
Rachel: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. 
(They degenerate into bickering and Chandler happily starts to smoke, undisturbed.)
[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are working.]
Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
Paula: No. 
Monica: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 
Paula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got
through! 
Monica: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing.
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. 
Paula: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how
you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! 
Monica: I know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
Paula: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. 
Monica: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. 
[Scene: Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.]
Joey: Do you have any respect for your body? 
Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your
emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
Rachel: (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to
speak to you. 
Chandler: Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she
told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's
not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that
before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.) 
Rachel: (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good. 
Ross: If only he were a woman. 
Rachel: Yeah. 
(They give each other a dubious look.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyond except Monica and Joey is watching Lambchop.] 
Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too. 
Ross: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) 
Monica: (entering) Hey. Where's Joey? 
Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was
wrong? 
Rachel: I think he's across the hall. 
Monica: Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.) 
Ross: (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. 
Chandler: (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? 
Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 
Ross: Hey, I might! 
Phoebe: Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars
for the thumb. 
All: You're kidding. Oh my God. 
Phoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the
universe?! 
Joey: (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going
on? 
Monica: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
Joey: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
Rachel: Uh, Joey.. 
Joey: Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.) 
Monica: (turns off the TV) Okay.. 
All: Oh! That was Lambchop! 
Monica: Please, guys, we have to talk. 
Phoebe: Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not. 
Monica: Alright, we have to talk. 
Phoebe: There it is! 
Monica: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I
mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. 
(They all gasp and clutch each other.)
Ross: Is there somebody else? 
Monica: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. 
Rachel: We didn't change.. 
Joey: So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
Phoebe: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about
someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) 
Monica: Look, I- I could go on pretending- 
Joey: Okay! 
Monica: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It
wouldn't be fair to you! 
Ross: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they
were. 
Monica: I'm sorry.. 
Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! 
Rachel: (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming
up- I wanted him to meet my family- 
Monica: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. 
All: Oh, yeah! Right! 
Monica: Are you guys gonna be okay? 
Ross: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. 
Monica: (dubious) I understand. 
[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica is breaking the news to Alan.]
Alan: Wow. 
Monica: I'm, I'm really sorry. 
Alan: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. 
Monica: Relieved? 
Alan: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.

Closing Credits 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is mopping around and eating ice cream.] 
Rachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 
Ross: Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
Monica: (entering) Hi. 
All: Mmm. 
Ross: So how'd it go? 
Monica: Oh, y'know.. 
Phoebe: Did he mention us? 
Monica: He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look) 
Ross: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her
forehead.) 
Chandler: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
All: No no no! 
Chandler: (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've
gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! 
Phoebe: (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven
thousand dollars! 
Chandler: (returns) Yeah, alright.
End[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there except Joey.] 
Monica: Alright. Phoebe? 
Phoebe: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! 
Ross: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? 
Chandler: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. 
Rachel: See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
"If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." (Joey enters.) 
All: Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. 
Monica: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? 
Joey: Probably kill myself! 
Monica: ..Excuse me? 
Joey: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! 
Ross: Joey, uh- OMnipotent. 
Joey: You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. 
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Monica are watching Phoebe
sleep.]
Monica: How does she do that? 
Ross: I cannot sleep in a public place. 
Monica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
Phoebe: (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. 
Ross: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. 
Monica: What's going on with you? 
Phoebe: I got no sleep last night! 
Ross: Why? 
Phoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! 
Monica: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. 
Phoebe: Thanks. 
(Chandler and Joey enter.  Joey is counting his
steps.) 
Joey: ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. 
Chandler: You got waaaay too much free time. 
Joey: (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking
you. 
Chandler: Happy birthday, pal! 
Joey: We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) 
Ross: Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. 
Joey: So? 
Ross: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? 
Chandler: Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is
half empty." 
Ross: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? 
Monica: Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. 
Ross: Ohhh. 
Joey: What's wrong with the twentieth? 
Chandler: Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? 
Ross: Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. 
Joey: The hell with hockey, let's all do that! 
Chandler: (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? 
Ross: What are you doing? 
Chandler: (stops) I have no idea. 
Joey: C'mon, Ross! 
Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? 
Chandler: You got it.
(Rachel runs up cluching an envelope.) 
Rachel: Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! 
Phoebe: I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. 
Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine? 
Phoebe: I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? 
Rachel: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. 
Chandler: (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. 
Joey: Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. 
Ross: You can totally, totally live on this. 
Monica: Yeah, yeah. 
Ross: Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. 
All: Oh! Yeah! 
(They all get their wallets out and give generous tips.)
Guys: Hockey! (They go to leave but are
blocked by three of Rachel's friends, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne.  The guys pause to
stare at them.) Hockey! Hockey. (The guys.) 
Leslie: (looking around) Rachel? 
Rachel: Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. 
Monica: (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. 
Rachel: What are you guys doing here? 
Kiki: Well, we were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true! 
Joanne: Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. 
Rachel: (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! 
Leslie: I know. I know! I'm a duplex. 
Rachel: (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
Joanne: Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) 
Kiki: And while we're on the subject of
news.. (She holds up here finger to show off her engagement ring and they all scream
again.) 
Phoebe: (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)
[Scene: A Street, Chandler and Joey are kicking a can to
each other.]
Chandler: ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) 
Joey: Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) 
Chandler: We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. 
Ross: Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. 
(They walk on.  Chandler and Joey start to talk but
Ross stops and whines.) 
Joey: What? 
Ross: Peach pit. 
Chandler: Yes, Bunny? 
Ross: (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-

Joey: -Peaches? 
Ross: Actually, nectarines, but basically... 
Chandler: (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
Ross: Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Joey: Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. 
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Lesile, Kiki, and Joanne are
talking.]
Rachel: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! 
Kiki: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! 
Joanne: Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
Rachel: Okay. 
Joanne: When are you coming home? 
Rachel: What? Guys, I'm not. 
Joanne: C'mon, this is us. 
Rachel: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- 
Kiki: Waitressing? 
Rachel: Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. 
Leslie: Well. Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are in
pajamas and Monica is making something in the blender as Rachel enters.] 
Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) 
Rachel: What's that? 
Monica: Weeeell, it's rum, and- 
Rachel: Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) 
Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) 
Phoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! 
Monica: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. 
Rachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want. 
Monica: (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. 
Rachel: But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
Monica: That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. 
Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? 
Monica: (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? 
Rachel: Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!
[Scene: Madison Square Garden, the guys are trying
to find their seats.] 
Ross: (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.

Chandler: What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? 
Ross: No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... 
Joey: C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, they're all hanging out in the
living room.]
Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! 
Rachel: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? 
Phoebe: You are just like Jack. 
Rachel: ...Jack from downstairs? 
Phoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk. 
Monica: Ah, the other Jack. 
Phoebe: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. 
Rachel: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- 
Phoebe: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. 
Rachel: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... 
Phoebe: Floopy? 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. 
Phoebe: Oh, like that's a word. 
Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? 
Monica: ...Pheebs? 
Phoebe: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. 
Rachel: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? 
[Scene: Madison Square Garden, the guys are
watching the game.]
Ross: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! 
Chandler: (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. 
Ross: Pass it! Pass it! 
Chandler: He's open! 
All: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
(The player shoots and the puck flies off the rink and hits
Ross in the face.  Chandler looks concered until he notices...) 
Chandler: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! 
(Chandler and Joey hold the puck and wave at the TV thing.)

Commercial Break
[Scene: An Emergency Room, Chandler and Joey are leading
Ross in.]
Chandler: (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
Receptionist: (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. 
Chandler: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)

Receptionist: (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) 
Ross: (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. 
Receptionist: Well, you'll have to wait your turn. 
Joey: Well, how long do you think it'll be? 
Receptionist: (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
Ross: Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the slumber party continues.]
Rachel: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. 
Monica: No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) 
Pizza Guy: (yelling from outside) Pizza
guy! 
Rachel: Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) 
Monica: Phoebe? 
Phoebe: What? 
Monica: Do you have a plan? 
Phoebe: I don't even have a 'pl'. 
Pizza Guy: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green
pepper and onion? 
Rachel: (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. 
Pizza Guy: Wait, you're not
'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me! 
Monica: (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' 
Pizza Guy: Yeah. This one goes across the
street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead! 
Monica: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? 
Pizza Guy: Yeah, that sounds about right. 
Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
Phoebe: And-and a power tie? 
Pizza Guy: No, pretty much just a towel. 
Monica: (staggered) Oh God. 
Pizza Guy: So you guys want me to take
this back? 
Monica: Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) 
Rachel: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? 
Phoebe: Big Bird's friend. 
Monica: I see pizza! 
Phoebe: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) 
Rachel: Hello? Who are we spying on? 
Monica: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? 
Rachel: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! 
Phoebe: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. 
Monica: Please tell me it's his mother. 
Phoebe: Definitely not his mother. 
Monica: Oh, no... 
Phoebe: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) 
[Scene: The Emergency Room, Joey is miming hockey pucks
kitting foreheads.  Chandler realises it's getting tense and goes to the receptionist
again.]
Chandler: Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all out on the
balcony.]
Monica: Light still out? 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Monica: Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
Rachel: Oh please, they're having sex. 
Monica and Phoebe: Shut up! 
Rachel: So, whaddya think George is like? 
Monica: I think he's shy. 
Phoebe: Yeah? 
Monica: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. 
[Scene: The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about
his first night with Carol.]
Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? 
Joey: He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. 
Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated... 
Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? 
Ross: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... 
Chandler: Then what? 
Ross: My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) 
Joey: What? 
Ross: It was my first time. 
Joey: With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. 
Joey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are still out on the
balcony.]
Monica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? 
Phoebe: Uh-huh. 
Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! 
Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. 
Monica: What?! You slept with Jason? 
Phoebe: You'd already broken up. 
Rachel: How long? 
Phoebe: A couple hours. 
Monica: Oh, that's nice! 
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. 
Monica: Excuse me?! 
Rachel: Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. 
Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! 
Rachel: I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) 
Phoebe: There he is! There he is! 
Monica: Where? 
Phoebe: Right- where we've been looking all night! 
Rachel: He is so cute! 
Monica: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! 
All: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. 
[Scene: The Emergency Room, Ross is absent.]
Joey: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? 
Chandler: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... 
Joey: Really? 
Chandler: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) 
Both: Hey, buddy. 
Ross: Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) 
Receptionist: (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. 
Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. 
Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? 
Joey: Oh, ah- the kid has it. 
Ross: The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. 
Kid: I found it. Finders keepers, losers
weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.) 
Chandler: You gotta do it, man. 
Ross: (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. 
Kid: No. 
Ross: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! 
Kid: No! No! (They start to fight over
it.) 
Receptionist: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
Ross: (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) 
Ross: ...Now that was fun. 
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey and the girls are playing
twister.]
Ross: (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot
red. 
Monica: Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo. 
(There's a knock on the door, Chandler opens it, and
silently hands back the cushion.) 
Chandler: Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 
Ross: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to
bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively) 
(The phone rings and Chandler answers it.) 
Chandler: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people. 
Rachel: Oh, okay. Will you take my place? 
Chandler: Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. 
Rachel: Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. 
Ross: Green. To the green. 
Rachel: (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. 
Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) 
Rachel: (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
End[Scene: Central Perk, all six are there.]
Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's
one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm
concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Joey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.
You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean
things, and then not even care.
(Long pause.)
Ross: Multiple orgasms!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, all are there.]
Chandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,
Sat-ur-day night!
Joey: No plans, huh?
Chandler: Not a one.
Ross: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Chandler: Oh, right, right, shut up.
Monica: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Chandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting
there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage
to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Joey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. 
Phoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. 
Phoebe: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. 
Ross: Tony?
Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Phoebe: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I
don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Rachel: (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey
pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Phoebe: (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Rachel: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Ross: That guy, he burns me up.
Rachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He
called me young lady.
Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing
again?
Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three
choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Phoebe: (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
(Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.)
Angela: Hi, Joey.
Joey: My god, Angela.
(Angela takes a seat at the counter.)
Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?
Joey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to
her) Hey, Angela. 
Angela: (casually) Joey.
Joey: You look good.
Angela: That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Joey: You don't say.
(Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.)
Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Rachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Ross: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry
there too?
Rachel: Who?
Ross: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you
both, here?
Rachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat
problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but
they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Rachel: Sure.
(Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.)
Angela: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Angela: Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.
You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Joey: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,
talking too.
Angela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Joey: What?
Angela: We're just friends.
Joey: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together
tonight? You know, as friends?
Angela: What four of us?
Joey: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose
as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take
Angela back for himself.]
Joey: Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Monica: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Joey: Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's
smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and
call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Monica: (looking out window) Oh, god help us.
Joey: What?
Monica: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Joey: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe
Angela will come back to me.
Monica: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Joey: (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up
with her. Will you help me? Please?
[Scene: Ross' apartment, Chandler is over.]
Ross: (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna
be me and Rachel.
Chandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing
through?
Ross: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Chandler: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're
going on a date.
Ross: Nuh-uh.
Chandler: Yuh-huh.
Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the
first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
Ross: (sheepish) No.
Chandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ross: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a
sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something
else up on the way.
Chandler: There you go.
[Scene: A fancy restaurant, Joey and Monica are there, meeting Angela and Bob, who
Monica thinks is Angela's brother.]
Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Joey: Yep.
Monica: Which?
Joey: Which what?
Monica: You've never met Bob, have you?
Joey: No, but he's...
Monica: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
(Angela and Bob walk in. Bob is good-looking.)
Angela: Hey, Joey.
Monica: ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their
significant others.]
Chandler: Where are they? Where are they?
Phoebe: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Chandler: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some
puppies.
Phoebe: Eww, I don't wanna do that.
(Janice and Phoebe's boyfriend, Tony, walk in.)
Chandler: Here we go.
Phoebe: Ok, have a good break-up.
Chandler: Hey, Janice.
Janice: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful
day.
Chandler: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,
please?
Janice: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the
little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day,
and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking,
I'm looking, I got you...
(Chandler sees Phoebe breaking up with Tony. She talks to him for a few seconds, hugs
him, and then he leaves. Chandler is amazed how easy it was for her.)
Chandler: What?
Janice: What?
Chandler: (covering) What... did you get me there? 
Janice: I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)
Chandler: Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Janice: Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can
wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match,
moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Chandler: That's great. 
(The drinks arrive, and Chandler downs his espresso in one gulp.)
Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Janice: (holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine.
(Chandler walks over to the counter where Phoebe is, and is asking her about the
break-up.)
Chandler: That's it?
Phoebe: Yeah, it was really hard.
Chandler: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Phoebe: Ok, you weren't there.
[Scene: The Launderama, Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel's
clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things.]
Woman: Comin' through. Move, move.
Rachel: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Woman: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Rachel: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Woman: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I
don't see suds.
Rachel: What?
Woman: No suds, no save. Ok?
(Ross arrives.)
Ross: What's goin' on?
Rachel: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Ross: Was your basket on top?
Rachel: Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Ross: So?
Rachel: Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Ross: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's
machine.
Woman: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Ross: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. 
(The woman and Ross stare at each other. Finally she takes her stuff out of the machine
and leaves.)
Ross: (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see
here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.
Rachel: That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Ross: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do
you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
(Ross pulls out a huge box of laundry detergent.)
Rachel: What's that?
Ross: Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
(Rachel starts to load her clothes.)
Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Rachel: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed
to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? 
Ross: Rach, have you never done this before?
Rachel: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.
Ross: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you
wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third
for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Rachel: (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these
are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Ross: (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
[Scene: Fancy restaurant, Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated at the table.]
Monica: (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow
up?
Angela: Brooklyn Heights.
Bob: Cleveland.
Monica: How, how did that happen?
Joey: Oh my god.
Monica: What?
Joey: I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Fancy restaurant, Joey and Bob are talking.]
Joey: So, you and Angela, huh?
Bob: Yep. Pretty much.
Joey: You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute
nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Bob: Huh, I never really noticed.
Joey: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Bob: Monica, Monica is great.
Joey: Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
[Scene: The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant, Monica and Angela are talking.]
Monica: I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Angela: Yeah, isn't he?
Monica: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an
emotional age beyond, like eight.
Angela: You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Monica: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Angela: Huh. That's nice.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up with Janice.]
Phoebe: Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it
really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
(Chandler walks back to couch, where Janice is.)
Chandler: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out
anymore. Janice.
Janice: All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins
to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.
[Scene: The laundromat.]
Rachel: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can
do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Ross: That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had
to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm
sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
Rachel: What uh-oh?
Ross: (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's
a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Rachel: Ross, what's the matter?
Ross: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Rachel: Come on, show me.
Ross: All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your
whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Rachel: Oh, everything's pink.
Ross: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please
don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Rachel: Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big
marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my
own! I can't even do laundry!
(The woman who had tried to steal the washing machine walks by, and laughs.)
[Scene: The fancy restaurant, Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt, and Monica is very
uncomfortable.]
Monica: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to
inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just
thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could
we check it in the light, please? 
(Her and Joey walk away from the table.)
Monica: Oh my god.
Joey: What?
Monica: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Joey: Come on, they're close.
Monica: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Joey: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Monica: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is
it?
Joey: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Monica: Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Joey: All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Monica: (hits him lightly) Oh! 
Joey: Ow!
Monica: (leaving) I'm outta here.
Joey: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Monica: Really?
Joey: Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,
we can break them up.
[Time lapse, Monica accidentally spilled her drink on Bob's shirt and is wiping it off.
Joey is making eyes at Angela.]
Monica: I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.
(Angela is eating chicken wings and making the weasel-like noise Joey had told Bob
about.)
Joey: Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is still trying to ease things over with Janice, and
there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.]
Chandler: Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out
and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
Janice: Ow!
Chandler: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Janice: Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
(She leaves.) 
Chandler: (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the
worst break-up in the history of the world. 
Phoebe: Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you
had?
Chandler: Oh, I don't know, a million?
Phoebe: Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Chandler: I'm fine.
Phoebe: All right. 
(Janice returns from the bathroom.)
Chandler: I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Phoebe: Wait here. Breathe.
(Phoebe goes over to speak to Janice. She talks to her for a few seconds, and then
Janice immediately smiles, hugs her, waves to Chandler, and leaves.)
Chandler: How do you do that?
Phoebe: It's like a gift.
Chandler: We should always always break up together.
Phoebe: Oh, I'd like that.
[Scene: The Launderama. Rachel is sorting her now-pink clothes.]
Ross: You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Rachel: Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
(The same woman walks over and takes Rachel's laundry cart.)
Rachel: Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Woman: Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get
outta my way.
(Rachel looks at Ross, who motions to her to get the cart back.)
Rachel: I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Woman: Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Rachel: Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Woman: Let go!
(They struggle for the cart. Finally, Rachel climbs inside of it.)
Rachel: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it! 
(She thinks it over, and then walks away.)
Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Rachel: I could not have done this without you.
(Rachel stands up and kisses Ross. He is stunned. A moment of silence follows.)
Ross: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
Rachel: Are you sure?
Ross: No.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Ross has an icepack to his
head.]
Rachel: Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Does it still hurt?
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe: (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm
gonna do this.
(Monica and Joey enter.)
Monica: Hi.
Phoebe: Hey, how'd it go?
Joey: Excellent.
Monica: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Ross: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Monica: (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
Rachel: Where's Chandler?
Phoebe: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
(Chandler runs by the window outside, joyous.)
Chandler: I'm free! I'm free!
Phoebe: That oughta do it.
End[Scene: A Theater, the gang is in the audience wating for a play of Joey's to
start.]
Rachel: (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's
picture! This is so exciting!
Chandler: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.
Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Phoebe: The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's
not just Freud, it's Freud!
(The lights dim.)
Ross: Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
(The lights go up on the stage, Joey, as Freud, is talking to a female patient.)
Joey: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say,
your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.) 

All you want is a dingle,
  What you envy's a schwang,
  A thing through which you can tinkle,
  Or play with, or simply let hang...


Opening Credits
[Scene: The Theater, the play has ended and everyone is applauding.  As soon as
the cast leaves, the gang all groan and sit down heavily.]
Rachel: God. I feel violated.
Monica: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,
to have something else to do?
Chandler: (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
Ross: Is it? Feels like two.
Chandler: No, ten o'clock.
Ross: What?
Chandler: (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,
nine, ten o'clock!
Ross: Oh. Hel-lo!
Chandler: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,
fat, bald men!
Monica: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Chandler: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.
Blarrglarrghh.'
Rachel: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Chandler: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross,
back me up here.
Ross: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Chandler: Thank you, buddy.
Phoebe: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with
these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Monica: You could do that!
Chandler: Y'think?
All: Yeah!
Chandler: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very
aware of my tongue...
Ross: C'mon! C'mon!
Chandler: Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
Aurora: ...Yes?
Chandler: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my
name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
Aurora: Yes, you said that.
Chandler: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,
what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,
goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.) 
Aurora: Chandler?
(Joey enters from behind a curtain.  The others all talk at once.)
All: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Joey: Whadja think?
(Pause)
All: ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Joey: C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did
with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
All: (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.
Chandler: (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,
man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name
'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the
usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
Rachel: What is it?
Joey: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe
they wanna sign me!
Phoebe: Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone else is there as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hey, kids. 
All: Hey.
Phoebe: (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...
just a line.
Chandler: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you
haven't asked me how my date went.
Monica: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Chandler: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the
most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
(A flashback of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk is denoted by
italics.)
Aurora: ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it
to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long,
I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Chandler: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I
rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Chandler: We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or
less.
Aurora: ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. 
Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Aurora: 'We' would be me and Rick.
Joey: Who's Rick?
Chandler: Who's Rick?
Aurora: My husband.
All: Ooooohhh.
Chandler: Oh, so you're divorced?
Aurora: No.
Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Aurora: No, I'm still married.
Chandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you
sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change
in my pocket?
Aurora: Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay
with Ethan.
Chandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Aurora: Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
All: What?!
Chandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do
you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Aurora: I suppose mainly sexual.
Chandler: ...Hm.
Monica: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Chandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you
listen to the story?
Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you
get involved with a woman like this?
Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I
look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none
of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Ross: No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out
with someone else?
Joey: I couldn't do it.
Monica: Good for you, Joey.
Joey: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with
more people than she is.
Ross: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,
anthropologically speaking-
(They all pretend to fall asleep.)
Ross: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Monica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
All: Yeah! C'mon!
Ross: Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
(They all fall asleep again.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as enter except Joey enter.]
Rachel: Tah-daaah!
Chandler: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Rachel: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all
the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't
know what that's for.
Ross: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Rachel: Well, whaddya think?
All: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Monica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
All: Uh-oh...
Monica: How-how did that happen?
Rachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an
extra seat around the coffee table.
Monica: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see
what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.
Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Phoebe: (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Chandler: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll
scratch your eyes right out.
Monica: You guys, I am not that bad!
Phoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a
little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Monica: That is so unfair!
Ross: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that
wasn't raggedy!
Monica: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Ross: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but
you don't pay it right away.
Monica: Why not?
Ross: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Monica: I could do that.
Rachel: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Monica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Chandler: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a
cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and
closer to the surface of the wood...
Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Ross: Monica? You're Mom.
(Monica gasps.)
Phoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
(Joey enters and he's on the phone.)
Joey: (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He
hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has
just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
All: Oh my God! Whoah!
Monica: Well, what's the part?
Joey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!
"I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of
order!"
Phoebe: Seriously, what-what's the part?
Joey: "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Ross: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Joey: ...I'm his (mumbles)
Rachel: ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Joey: ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes
into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
Joey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's
big!
Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after
all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into
showbusiness.
Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Ross: You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big
opening?
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Monica is getting the door.]
Monica: Alright, alright, alright... 
(Joey enters with Monica's paper and hands it to her.)
Joey: Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Monica: For what?
Joey: Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Monica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't
ever tell me what you did in there.
Joey: Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
(Chandler enters with the phone.)
Chandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Monica: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Chandler: C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs
back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
Monica: I warned you...
(Rachel enters from her room.)
Rachel: Who is being loud?
Chandler: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,
Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Monica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Chandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He
starts to raid the fridge.)
Rachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Chandler: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a
relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your
life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about
thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
(He has armloads of stuff.)
Monica: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind
you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. 
(She opens the door and he leaves.)
[Scene: A Film Set, Joey is entering for his scene.]
Director: (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.)
Okay, everybody ready?
Joey: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Director: Lose the robe.
Joey: Me?
Director: That would work.
Joey: Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is
lost.
Director: Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll
it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action.
(Joey starts to the shower with a grim, determined look on his face.)
Director: And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Joey: Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Director: No, that was clenching.
Joey: Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his
wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Director: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again,
rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Joey: I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler's room.]
Chandler: God, I love these fingers...
Aurora: Thank you.
Chandler: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they
are.
Aurora: (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She
starts to get up.)
Chandler: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her
back down.)
Aurora: Okay.
Chandler: Don't go.
Aurora: Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Chandler: (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
Aurora: (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Chandler: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Aurora: It's not Rick.
Chandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Aurora: No, it's-it's Andrew. 
Chandler: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret
asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Aurora: He's... new.
Chandler: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,
Ethan and myself?
Aurora: No, that's not exactly what I was..
Chandler: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Aurora: So what do you want?
Chandler: You.
Aurora: You have me!
Chandler: Nono, just you.
Aurora: Whaddyou mean?
Chandler: Lose the other guys.
Aurora: ...Like, ...all of them?
Chandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Aurora: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and
laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I
thought that's what you wanted too.
Chandler: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,
y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.
Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!
Get out!'
Aurora: So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Chandler: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly
let each other finish...
Aurora: Which one?
Chandler: ...The second guy.
Aurora: (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.
(She kisses him, he holds her, and kisses her passionately.)
Chandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
(She leaves, Chandler sighs, and falls back on his bed.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler.  Joey is absent.]
Ross: Look at it this way: you dumped her.
Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
(Joey enters.)
All: Hey!
Monica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al
Pacino movie?
Joey: Nope.
Ross: No? What happened, big guy?
Chandler: (to Ross) "Big guy?"
Ross: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Joey: I got fired.
All: Oh!
Joey: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now
everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Rachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Joey: My mom will.
Chandler: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally
get my shot, and I blow it!
Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's
your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Joey: Hard to tell, I was naked.
Phoebe: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you
just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've
gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go
'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
(Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)
Monica: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. 
All: Night.
Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Monica: (determined) Uh-huh!
Rachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Monica: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her
room.)
Ross: She is a kook.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, she's lying in bed wide awake.]
Monica: (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have
to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them,
and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head
in her pillow.) 
EndJill: (on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Chandler: She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in
an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an
atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Jill: (on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM
vestibule.
Chandler: Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Jill: (on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Chandler: Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last
night. Yes, he was some guy. 
(Chandler strides proudly across the vestibule and Jill stares at him.)
[Scene: Monica's apartment, Joey enters with a menorah, the candles lit.]
Joey: Hi everyone.
Ross: And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Joey: Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we
have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Phoebe: (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
(They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.)
Rachel: That had to hurt!
[Scene: ATM vestibule.]
Chandler: Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes
and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
(Chandler smiles at her, she smiles back sweetly.)
Chandler: There you go!
(He continues to smile like an idiot, and she looks frightened.)
Chandler: You're definitely scaring here.
Jill: (awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)
Chandler: Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
(takes phone)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The phone rings; it's Chandler.]
Monica: Hello?
Chandler: Hey, it's me.
Monica: (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
Chandler: Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an
ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Monica: What?
Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Monica: I have no idea what you just said.
Chandler: (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
Joey: What's up man?
Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Joey: (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill
Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
Chandler: Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time has passed. The five are sitting around the coffee
table talking.]
Rachel: Alright, somebody.
Monica: OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
All: Whoooaa!
Ross: That's my sister.
Joey: OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second
floor of the New York CIty public library.
Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Ross: Pheebs, what about you?
Phoebe: Oh... Milwaukee.
Rachel: Um... Ross?
Ross: Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
All: No way!
Ross: The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those
mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom.
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel.
Rachel: Oh come on, I already went.
Monica: You did not go!
All: Come on.
Rachel: Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the
foot of the bed. 
Ross: Step back.
Joey: We have a winner!
[Time lapse, Ross and Rachel are talking, Joey is on the couch, and Monica and Phoebe
are out of the room.]
Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,
where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Ross: Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Rachel: There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf
course. 
Ross: Come on.
Rachel: No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Ross: (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
Rachel: I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having
that kind of...
Ross: Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.

Rachel: Yeah right.
Ross: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're
left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,
you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that
other good stuff.
Rachel: (sigh) OK.
Ross: But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Rachel: You don't.
Ross: Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Rachel: Really?
Ross: Mmmm.
Rachel: You do?
Ross: I do.
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
(Ross gets up, pleased with himself.)
Joey: It's never gonna happen.
Ross: (innocently) What?
Joey: You and Rachel.
Ross: (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
Joey: Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend
zone. 
Ross: No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Joey: Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Ross: I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,
every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Joey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're
thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Ross: I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)
What? What, now?
Joey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?
You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the
room behind them)
Ross: Shhhh!
Rachel: What are you shushing?
Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.
(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
Rachel: Ahhhh!
Ross: See?
Rachel: Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
[Scene: ATM vestibule.]
Jill: Would you like some gum?
Chandler: Um, is it sugarless?
Jill: (checks) Sorry, it's not.
Chandler: Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill
Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take
it.
[Scene: Monica's apartment, Phoebe is singing.]
Phoebe: (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But
to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she
writes the lyrics down)
Ross: (to Joey) OK, here goes.
Joey: Are you going to do it?
Ross: I'm going to do it.
Joey: Do you want any help?
Ross: You come out there, you're a dead man.
Joey: Good luck, man.
Ross: Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
Joey: OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
(Monica walks in, starts to go out on the balcony.)
Joey: Hey, where are you going?
Monica: Outside.
Joey: You can't go out there.
Monica: Why not?
Joey: Because of... the reason.
Monica: And that would be?
Joey: I, um, can't tell you.
Monica: Joey, what's going on?
Joey: OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told
you.
Monica: About what?
Joey: He's planning your birthday party.
Monica: Oh my God! I love him!
Joey: (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
Phoebe: About what?
Monica: My surprise party!
Phoebe: What surprise party?
Monica: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Phoebe: Well, he didn't tell me.
Joey: Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Phoebe: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Monica: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Phoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the
peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was
moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks
like I was second to last.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Ross and Rachel are talking.]
Rachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.
Ross: OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment.
Rachel: OK.
Ross: OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Rachel: Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
Ross: Yes, yes, that's right...
Rachel: Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
Ross: What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
[Cut to inside. Monica, Joey and Phoebe are singing while outside, Ross and Rachel are
trying to get the cat off of Ross' shoulder.]
Monica, Joey, and Phoebe: (singing) I'm on top of the world,
looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found
ever since...
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is holding the cat, Monica is treating the
scratches on Ross' back. Joey is holding the menorah over the wound.]
Monica: (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
(Ross flinches in pain.)
Joey: Sorry, that was wax.
Phoebe: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Rachel: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Ross: (nonchalantly) Yeah?
[Scene: ATM vestibule.]
Chandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him
a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be
perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no,
no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
[Scene: The hallway of Monica's building. Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the
cat's owner.]
Phoebe: (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,
right?
Rachel: Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found
this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Mr. Heckles: Er, yeah, it's mine.
Phoebe: (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you
sure?
Mr. Heckles: Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Phoebe: Wait a minute. What's his name?
Mr. Heckles: Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Rachel: Bob Buttons?
Mr. Heckles: Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Phoebe: (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Mr. Heckles: (as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat.
[Scene: Rachel has gone off on her own to look for the cat's owner.]
Rachel: Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little
kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
(While looking at the floor for the cat, Rachel runs into a pair of legs. She slowly
gets up and sees a gorgeous Italian hunk holding the cat. Who, by the way, you'll hate
very, very soon. The man. Not the cat.)
Paolo: (something Italian)
Rachel: Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Monica, and Joey are playing Monopoly.]
Ross: (rolling) Lucky sixes....
Rachel: (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I
want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Monica: (smitten) Hi!
Rachel: And Joey....
Monica: Hi!
Rachel: And Ross.
Monica: Hi!
Paolo: (something in Italian)
Rachel: (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
Paolo: (pointing at game) Monopoly! 
Rachel: Look at that!
Ross: (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Rachel: Oh... Italy, I think.
Ross: No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Rachel: Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Ross: That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.
(Phoebe enters.)
Phoebe: Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty
anywhere.
Rachel: Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Phoebe: Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since
nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Rachel: Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Paolo: (something in Italian, he is apparently attracted to Phoebe)
Phoebe: (smiling) You betcha!
[Scene: ATM vestibule.]
Chandler: (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's
good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
(Chandler waits until Jill is looking, then starts to blow a bubble. But instead of
blow one, he accidentally spits the gum out of his mouth and hits the wall.)
Chandler: Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and
put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in
his mouth.)
Chandler: Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing
someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're
choking. 
(Chandler starts to choke.)
Jill: Are you alright?
(Chandler tries to save face and makes the 'OK' sign with his hands, while obviously
unable to breathe.)
Jill: My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum
flies from his mouth) That better?
Chandler: (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Jill: Perfection?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Paolo are at the window. Ross and Joey are
watching disgustedly.]
Paolo: (something romantic in Italian about Rachel and the stars)
Ross: (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
(Rachel walks away from Paolo, laughing.)
Ross: Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Rachel: I have absolutely no idea.
Ross: That's... that's classic.
Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I
doing? This is so un-me!
Monica: If you want, I'll do it.
(Ross looks at Joey.)
Phoebe: I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I
won't.
Rachel: God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more
exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Phoebe: You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at
her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Rachel: Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing
in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
[Cut to the other side of the apartment, Ross has gone over to straighten things out
with Paolo.]
Ross: Paolo. Hi.
Paolo: Ross!
(Ross notices that Paolo is standing on a step, which makes him taller. Ross gets up on
the same step so he can look down at Paolo.)
Ross: Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...
we're kind of a thing.
Paolo: Thing?
Ross: Thing, yes. Thing.
Paolo: Ah, you... have the sex?
Ross: No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,
that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.
You know, and if you get in the.... um... 
Paolo: Bed?
Ross: No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way,
of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Paolo: Oh!
Ross: Yeah! Se vice?
Paolo: Si.
Ross: So you do know a little English.
Paolo: Poco... a leetle.
Ross: Do you know the word crapweasel?
Paolo: No.
Ross: That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
(They hug.)
[Scene: ATM vestibule, Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens
dangling from their chains in front of them. Jill is showing Chandler how to swing the pen
around his head.]
Jill: Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
Chandler: OK.
Jill: Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)
(Chandler tries to do the same thing but the pen hits him in the head.)
Jill: No, you've got to whip it. 
(He swings the pen hard, and it snaps back and almost hits him again.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all sitting around the table.]
Phoebe: Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...
(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room
gets completely dark)
Ross: Thank you.
Phoebe: Thanks.
Ross: Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Joey: (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
(Everyone starts to imitate him.)
Ross: OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
(The lights come back on, and Rachel and Paolo are making out. Ross clutches his
chest.)
Ross: Oh.. oh... oh.
Joey: Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have
to throw a party for Monica.
Closing Credits
[Scene: ATM vestibule, the power has come back on.]
Jill: Well, this has been fun.
Chandler: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my
life.
Jill: Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the
cheek) See ya.
(She leaves. Chandler presses his face to the glass door after her, stroking the window
lovingly. He then turns to the security camera and starts talking to it.)
Chandler: Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got
any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.

EndChandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get
better than this?
Shelley: Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody
who would be perfect for you.
Chandler: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or
'self-destructive'...
Shelley: Do you want a date Saturday?
Chandler: Yes please.
Shelley: Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Chandler: He's a he?
Shelley: Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna
go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye...
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.)
Chandler: ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that
ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Rachel: Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,
possibly, you might be... 
Chandler: You did?
Rachel: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my
breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Chandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first
met me?
Monica: I did.
Phoebe: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Joey: Not me.
Ross: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor
did.
Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Ross: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I
told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
(Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler's look and abruptly stops.)
Chandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Phoebe: I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Chandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
All: Yeah! Right!
Chandler: WHAT IS IT?!
Monica: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
All: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Chandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be
vague about this.
(Phone rings; Monica gets it)
Monica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. 
Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.

Ross: (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to
Rome.
Rachel: Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to
Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.
Monica: Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
[Scene: The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and
Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.)
Ross: So, uh, how's she doing?
Aunt Lillian: The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Monica: How-how are you, Mom?
Mrs. Geller: Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Monica: What?
Mrs. Geller: What's different?
Monica: Nothing.
Mrs. Geller: Oh, maybe that's it.
(Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside.)
Monica: She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Ross: Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Monica: Oh God!
(They hug.)
[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]
Monica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 
Ross: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'
Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Mr. Geller: Not just restaurants, from our house.
(The nurse comes out of Nana's room.)
Nurse: Mrs. Geller?
(Everyone stands up. Cut to Ross and Monica in Nana's room.)
Ross: She looks so small. 
Monica: I know.
Ross: Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. 
Monica: G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
Ross: Bye, Nana. 
(He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in
disbelief. Monica runs out of the room.)
Monica: Ross!
(Ross runs out too.)
Mrs. Geller: What is going on?!
Ross: Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,
quite..
Mrs. Geller: What?
Ross: She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Aunt Lillian: (reentering) What's going on?
Mr. Geller: She may have died.
Aunt Lillian: She may have died?
Mr. Geller: We're looking into it.
(Monica returns with the nurse and they go into Nana's room.)
Ross: I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)
Nurse: This almost never happens!
(Nana passes for the second time and the nurse pulls the blanket over her. Ross and
Monica go to tell the family)
Ross: Now she's passed.
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there.]
Chandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Rachel: (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Phoebe: Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
(Monica and Ross enter.)
Rachel: So, um, did she...
Ross: Twice.
Joey: Twice?
Phoebe: Oh, that sucks!
Joey: You guys okay?
Ross: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,
uh...
Phoebe: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Ross: Nono, she's gone.
Monica: We checked. A lot.
Phoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every
now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand
around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And
Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf
course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little
yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Rachel: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)
Phoebe: Thanks!
Rachel: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Joey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're
dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,
huh?
Phoebe: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the
pencil)
[Scene: Nana's house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes.]
Ross: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Mrs. Geller: Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
(They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers)
Mrs. Geller: Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Ross: (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
(He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and
climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout.)
Ross: Here's my retainer!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to her father.]
Mr. Geller: I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Monica: Dad!
Mr. Geller: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Monica: You what?
Mr. Geller: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. 
Monica: Define fun.
Mr. Geller: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Monica: ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Mr. Geller: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so
predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Monica: That's probably what they'll say.
Mr. Geller: I'd like that.
[Scene: Chandler's Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hey, gorgeous.
Shelley: (sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Chandler: No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other
people have made the same mistake.
Shelley: Oh! Okay! Phew! 
Chandler: So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Shelley: I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Chandler: ...Quality, right, great.
Shelley: Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great
couple.
Chandler: Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Shelley: What? He's cute!
Chandler: Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Shelley: Is Brian...?
Chandler: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with
someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Shelley: Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Chandler: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get
a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
[Scene: Nana's Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet.]
Ross: (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
Aunt Lillian: No.
Ross: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend
eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Aunt Lillian: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong
one.
Mrs. Geller: You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Ross: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
Aunt Lillian: Wait! We need shoes!
(Ross falls back inside)
Ross: Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)
Mrs. Geller: That's really a day shoe.
Ross: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Aunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Ross: (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Aunt Lillian: No, it really should be burgundy.
Mrs. Geller: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Ross: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
(He finds a shoebox (out of shot), pulls it down and opens it. It is full of Sweet
'n' Lo's.)
Ross: Oh my God..
Mrs. Geller: Is everything all right, dear?
Ross: Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
(He reaches up higher and knocks down another shoebox lid. Sweet 'n' Lo's rain
down on him)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral.]
Ross: (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
Monica: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did
you know my ears are not my best feature?
Ross: Some days it's all I can think about. 
Phoebe: (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Rachel: Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Phoebe: What'd I say?
Rachel: (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
Monica: Are these the shoes?
Rachel: Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Ross: What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Joey: (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
Chandler: Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't
it?
(They all leave.)
[Scene: The cemetary, after the funeral.]
Monica: It was a really beautiful service.
Mrs. Geller: It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think
it might be time for you to start using night cream.
(Joey listens to his overcoat for a second and sighs, then notices Chandler watching)
Joey: What?
Chandler: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Joey: Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)
Chandler: You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Joey: No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Chandler: You are a frightening, frightening man.
(Rachel steps in a patch of mud)
Rachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Ross: Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Phoebe: God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Ross: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,
there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he
falls into an open grave)
All: God! Ross!
Ross: I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
[Scene: The Wake, at the Gellers' house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe
squatting over him, checking to see if he's injured.]
Phoebe: Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in
spasm...huh.
Ross: What, what is it?
Phoebe: You missed a belt loop. 
Ross: Oh! No-n-
Phoebe: Okay, it's in spasm.
Mrs. Geller: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
(Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)
(Cut to Chandler and a woman, Andrea, reaching for the same slice of meat)
Chandler: Oh, no-
Andrea: Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Chandler: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
(They shake hands. Cut to Ross emerging from a hallway, grinning inanely. He is
obviously very stoned)
Phoebe: Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Ross: I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Monica: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Ross: Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys
are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
Phoebe: Ooh! That's so nice...
Ross: ...Chandler! 
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to
me.
Andrea: (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)
Ross: Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
Rachel: (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Ross: No.
Rachel: You!
Ross: Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
(Cut to Joey watching TV in the corner. He makes an extravagant gesture of
disappointment.)
Mr. Geller: Whaddya got there?
Joey: (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing
disability.
Mr. Geller: What's the score?
Joey: Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Mr. Geller: Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)
(Time lapse. A large crowd of men are now watching the game)
Rachel: (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Mrs. Geller: (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.
Monica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Mrs. Geller: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',
I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting
your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Monica: That sounds like Nana.
Mrs. Geller: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?
Monica: ...I can imagine.
Mrs. Geller: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the
positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Monica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all
over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Mrs. Geller: Tell her what?
Monica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your
hair... for example.
Mrs. Geller: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Monica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the
truth?
Mrs. Geller: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's
nicer when people just get along. 
Monica: Huh.
Mrs. Geller: More wine, dear?
Monica: Oh, I think so.
Mrs. Geller: (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Monica: Thank you. They're yours.
Mrs. Geller: Actually they were Nana's.
(There is a cry of disappointment from the crowd of men.)
Mr. Geller: Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.
[Scene: Central Perk, the gang are looking at old photos.]
Rachel: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Ross: That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel: Aww, look at the little thing.
Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler: Who are those people?
Ross: Got me.
Monica: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. 
Rachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ross: Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
Joey: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ross: (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler is on a coffee break as Lowell enters.]
Chandler: Hey, Lowell.
Lowell: Hey, Chandler.
Chandler: So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Lowell: It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Chandler: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,
uh... I'm not.
Lowell: I know. That's what I told her.
Chandler: Really.
Lowell: Yeah.
Chandler: So- you can tell?
Lowell: Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Chandler: So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Lowell: Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend
Brian from Payroll, he is.
Chandler: He is?
Lowell: Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)
Chandler: Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I
wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
End[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry.]
Rachel: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was
wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Terry: An advance?
Rachel: It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we
go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the
whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Terry: Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really,
really awful.
Rachel: Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm
trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?
(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer.]
Rachel: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do
you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Guy: Huh?
Rachel: Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.
(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. 
(Monica enters.)
Monica: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for
Thanksgiving?
Ross: No, they're not.
Monica: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Ross: You're wrong.
Monica: I am not wrong.
Ross: You're wrong.
Monica: No, I just talked to them.
Ross: (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.
(Joey enters. His face looks abnormally colorful.)
Joey: Hey, hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey.
Chandler: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Joey: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Chandler: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey
Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Phoebe: What were you modeling for?
Joey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Monica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy
guys"?
Phoebe: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Chandler: Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Joey: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) 
Chandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Joey: Thanks.
(Ross comes back to the couch.)
Ross: (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's
Thanksgiving. 
Monica: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make
it just like Mom's.
Ross: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Monica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her
sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Joey: Yeah.
Monica: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim
holidays.
Chandler: Yes, every single one of them.
Monica: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Phoebe: Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December
'cause he is lunar.
Monica: So you're free Thursday, then.
Phoebe: Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Monica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Rachel: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Chandler: I thought it was $98.50.
Rachel: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Ross: Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Phoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Ross: (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
[Scene: Carol and Susan's apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.]
Ross: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Susan: No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Ross: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan:
Come in.
Ross: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to
the museum.
Susan: What's it look like?
Ross: Kinda like a big face without skin.
Susan: Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ross: Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about
bein' a lesbian.
Susan: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you
do it. 
Ross: (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Susan: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Ross: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...
crazy?
Susan: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Ross: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Susan: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Ross: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Susan: Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Ross: Really?
Susan: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]
Ross: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly
time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Phoebe: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can
show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,
and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Chandler: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head.
(Rachel enters.)
Monica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Rachel: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,
shoop, shoop.
Monica: Rach, here's your mail.
Rachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Monica: (insistently) No, here's your mail.
Rachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Monica: (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
(Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.)
Rachel: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Monica: We all chipped in.
Joey: (to Monica) We did?
Monica: (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
Rachel: Thank you. Thank you so much!
Monica: (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional
Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family
size bag of Funyuns.
Rachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving
dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Chandler: All right, I'm nine years old.
Ross: Oh, I hate this story.
Chandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I
remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Rachel: Oh my god.
Chandler: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once
you've seen it in reverse.
[Scene: The subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her.]
Joey: Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Girl: We did?
Joey: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.
(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? 
Girl: Yeah, right.
Joey: I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Girl: Get out.
Joey: I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Girl: Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Joey: Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Girl: (provocatively) Nothing.
Joey: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Girl: Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.
Joey: What's wrong?
Girl: I just remembered, I have to do something.
Joey: Oh. What?
Girl: Um, leave.
Joey: Wait, wait, wait!
(Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway. The poster says: What
Mario isn't telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are
shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang.]
Joey: So I guess you all saw it.
Rachel: Saw what?
Phoebe: No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey enters, upset.]
Joey: Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Chandler: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is
standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities.]
Monica: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are
yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
Ross: I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Monica: All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop
moping.
Ross: That's closer.
(Rachel enters, excited.)
Rachel: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,
shoop.
Chandler: Oh, you must stop shooping.
Rachel: Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Joey: Chandler, will you just come in already?
Chandler: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
(Phoebe takes a slice of pumpkin pie and waves it in front of Chandler's face.)
Phoebe: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Chandler: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not
funny anymore.
(Chandler leaves.)
Joey: Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Monica: That's not a question.
Joey: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little
piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't
be with my family because of my disease.
Monica: All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and
in the form of tots.
Ross: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. 
(Ross grabs for some food, Monica slaps his hand away.)
Monica: Ah!
Ross: Ok, Mom never hit.
(Ross exits.)
Phoebe: (stirring pot) Ok, all done.
Monica: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then
add some peas and onions.
Monica: Why would we do that?
Phoebe: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,
before she died.
Monica: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Rachel: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and
hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
(Chandler enters, running.)
Chandler: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten
away.
Joey: The balloon?
Chandler: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all
over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Rachel: I can't, I gotta go.
Chandler: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often
does that happen?
Phoebe: Almost never.
Monica: Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Rachel: Ok.
(Everyone leaves the apartment.)
[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly.]
Carol: Anytime you're ready.
Ross: Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I
talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain
acoustical advantage, but...
Carol: Just aim for the bump.
Ross: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this
is too weird. I feel stupid.
Carol: So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan
does it.
Ross: (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the group is coming back from the roof.]
Rachel: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the
park.
Phoebe: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Monica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on
the inside. Why are we standing here?
Rachel: We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Monica: No I don't.
Rachel: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Monica: No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Rachel: No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?
Monica: (panicked) The oven is on.
Rachel: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Joey: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Monica: Well then get it, get it!
Joey: That tone will not make me go any faster.
Monica: (angry) Joey!
Joey: That one will. 
(Joey leaves to get the copy of the key.)
[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach.]
Ross: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.
So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's
face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Carol: Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Ross: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
(Susan enters.)
Susan: Hi, how's it goin?
Ross: Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest
looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Carol: I did.
Ross: Does it always, uh--?
Carol: No, no that was the first.
Susan: Keep singing! Keep singing!
Ross: (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When
you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Susan: I felt it!
Ross: (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
[Scene: The Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.]
Joey: Nope, not that one.
Monica: Can you go any faster with that?
Joey: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Monica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Chandler: (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
Rachel: (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't
for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a
gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.
Monica: I swear you said you had the keys.
Rachel: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I
obviously didn't have the keys.
Phoebe: Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
(Short pause.)
Monica: Why would I have the keys?
Rachel: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Monica: But I didn't.
Rachel: Well, you should have.
Monica: Why?
Rachel: Because!
Monica: Why?
Rachel: Because!
Monica: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm
making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of
potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of
potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,
and, and I... I...
Chandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.
Here we go.
(They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)
Monica: Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes
are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
(Ross enters, singing.)
Ross: Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.
Monica: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan
of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Rachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck
here with you guys.
Joey: Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Monica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?
Joey: You call that delicious? 
(all shouting)
Monica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Chandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
[Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]
Phoebe: Ooh. 
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not
alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
(They all run to the window.)
Joey: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Monica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Phoebe: It's nice that he has someone.
[Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches.]
Chandler: Shall I carve?
Rachel: By all means.
Chandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Ross: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Monica: (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Joey: Oh, I will.
Phoebe: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Monica: Make a wish?
Phoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd
you wish for?
Joey: The bigger half.
Chandler: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this
isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been
really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with
your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings
sucked.
All: That's so sweet.
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel: And a crappy New Year.
Chandler: Here, here!
Closing Credits
[Scene: The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster,
revealing more posters underneath. The captions read, as follows: 


Bladder Control Problem
    Stop Wife Beating
    Hemorrhoids?
    Winner of 3 Tony Awards... 


He's finally happy with that and walks away.]

End[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
(A monkey jumps on to his shoulder.)
All: Oooh!
Monica: W-wait. What is that?
Ross: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Monica: No, no, I don't.
Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Ross: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Phoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Ross: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?
Ross: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is
kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really
cool way to live'.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there.]
Phoebe: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs
about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman.
(Enter Joey)
All: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Monica: So, how'd it go?
Joey: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Ross: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Joey: I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even
jolly, it's all political.
Monica: So what are you gonna be?
Joey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,
y'know?
Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all
protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible
pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can
have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Rachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so
I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. 
Phoebe: Yeah, you wish!
Chandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
All: Yeah, okay. Alright.
Chandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
All: Woooo! Yeah!
Rachel: Phoebe, you're on.
Phoebe: Oh, oh, good.
Rachel: (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular
demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Phoebe: (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot
to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:) 

I made a man with eyes of coal
  And a smile so bewitchin',
  How was I supposed to know
  That my mom was dead in the kitchen?
  (shakes bell) La lalala la la la la lalala la la...

(Cut to later. Everyone is totally depressed by now.)
Phoebe: (Sung) 

...My mother's ashes
  Even her eyelashes
  Are resting in a little yellow jar,
  And sometimes when it's breezy...

(Over the sound of Phoebe singing we hear two scientists, Max and David, having a noisy
discussion)
Phoebe: (Sung) 

...I feel a little sneezy
  And now I- (abruptly stops) 

Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is
it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Max: No. No, that's- that's okay.
Phoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then
I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Chandler: (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
David: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Phoebe: Could you speak up please?
David: (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my
friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my
life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Max: Daryl Hannah.
David: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life
and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I
thought she had kind of a 
Max: Hard quality.
David: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional
way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you
started yelling. (Sits down)
Phoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)
Joey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas.]
Ross: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)
Rachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my
sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just
share too much?
Ross: Just a smidge.
Phoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Monica: I think it's romantic.
Phoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Rachel: Yeah!
Phoebe: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except
he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the
time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 
Chandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna
ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the
pact.
Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Chandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Monica: What?!
Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
Chandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Monica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Chandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
[Joey enters, his shoes have bells on, which jingle as he walks. He is wearing a long
coat.]
Joey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
(He removes the coat to reveal an elf costume)
Chandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
Joey: Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!
(Marcel knocks over some kitchen tools)
Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?
Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this
morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,
and he- he threw some faeces...
Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Ross: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're
there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Chandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
[Scene: Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a
whiteboard.]
David: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle
accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Phoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then. 
David: Yuh.
Phoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
David: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be
(Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss
that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Phoebe: Sure.
David: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to
be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I
just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not
really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Phoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a
sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
David: Rrrreally.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and
throw me. 
David: ...Now? Now?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, right now.
David: Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop
computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks
up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)
Phoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. 
David: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the
desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
Phoebe: I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
(They kiss, finally)
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Ross: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Monica: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has
somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Monica: Yeah.
Joey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Chandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Rachel: (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...
Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Rachel: (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
Ross: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Joey: Uh, four.
Ross: Four.
Rachel: Five.
Ross: Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
Rachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Joey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to
do?
Ross: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball
drops?
Rachel: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's
with who.
Ross: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Monica: What's the matter?
Ross: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking
around all the time dragging his hands... 
Chandler: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Ross: Really.
Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Ross: What, uh... what juggling thing?
Chandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Ross: No.
Chandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a
melon...
(Max runs in)
Max: Phoebe. Hi. 
Phoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Max: No. Have you seen David?
Phoebe: No, no, he hasn't been around.
Max: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Phoebe: Minsk?
Max: Minsk. It's in Russia.
Phoebe: I know where Minsk is.
Max: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
Phoebe: So when, when do you leave?
Max: January first.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Max and David's lab, they are working. Phoebe knocks on the door]
Phoebe: Hello?
David: Hey!
Phoebe: Hi.
David: Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?
Phoebe: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)
congratulations! This is so exciting!
Max: It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Phoebe: Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?
Max: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and
Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my
girlfriend!!' (Storms out)
David: Thank you, Max. Thank you.
Phoebe: So-so you're really not going?
David: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Phoebe: Oh don't do that.
David: Please.
Phoebe: Oh no no.
David: No, but I'm asking-
Phoebe: Oh, but I can't do that-
David: No, but I can't-
Phoebe: It's your thing, and-
David: -make the decision-
Phoebe: Okay, um, stay.
David: Stay.
Phoebe: Stay.
(He thinks for a moment and sweeps the stuff off the table)
Phoebe: Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
David: It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the party has started.]
Janice: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet
starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)
Chandler: You remember Janice.
Monica: Vividly.
(Someone knocks on the door; Monica gets it)
Monica: Hi.
Sandy: Hi, I'm Sandy.
Joey: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger
girl)...You brought your kids.
Sandy: Yeah. That's okay, right?
(Joey and Monica look at each other and shrug. Ross enters with Marcel on his shoulder)
Ross: Par-tay! 
Monica: That thing is not coming in here.
Ross: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you
something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your
home?
Monica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Ross: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to
have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Monica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Ross: Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a
little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
(The door opens. Rachel is standing there. Her coat is muddy and torn, her hair is
dishevelled and her face is bruised. Everyone turns to look)
Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Rachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Phoebe: And then... your face is bloated?
Rachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-
this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her
cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my
hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm
going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my
whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
[Time lapse. Monica and Rachel, fixed up somewhat, emerge from a bedroom]
Sandy: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first
time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Joey: Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Sandy: Yeah.
(They almost kiss and then Joey realises her kids are staring at them)
Joey: Hey, kids...
Ross: (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not
saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Janice: (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Chandler: (Imitating) But you found me!
Janice: Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts
snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Chandler: Kill me. Kill me now. 
(Someone else knocks on the door. Monica looks through the spyhole)
Monica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
(Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed)
Fun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two
hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Joey: (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
(Monica gestures wildly behind Fun Bobby's back) 
[Time lapse. Bobby is talking about his grandfather. Everyone else is virtually in
tears]
Fun Bobby: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see
him again.
Janice: (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and
I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Chandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I
invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Janice: Oh, no. Oh, no.
Chandler: I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Janice: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these
times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)
(Ross is still taking photos)
Chandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
(David is feeding Phoebe popcorn. Max walks up)
Phoebe: Hi, Max!
Max: Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
David: Wow.
Max: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)
Phoebe: Are you alright?
David: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
(Phoebe leads David into a bedroom)
Phoebe: You're going to Minsk.
David: No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Phoebe: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here
just 'cause of me.
David: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I
can't break up with you.
Phoebe: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and
that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say
that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you
understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
David: Uh, ow.
Phoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you
put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and
you'll never forget me.
David: I'll never forget you.
Phoebe: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because
you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna
miss you. You scientist guy.
Dick Clark: (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a
virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
(Joey puts a blanket over Sandy's kids)
Joey: There y'go, kids.
Chandler: (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.
(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
Joey: You seen Sandy?
Chandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's
bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to
tell you.
Rachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
All: (in the kitchen) What?
Rachel: The bll is drrbing!
Dick Clark: (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
Chandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.
Joey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Phoebe: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Monica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
(Bobby waves and then bursts into tears. Midnight comes and everyone at the party
except for the gang cheers and kisses)
Chandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,
but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
Phoebe: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Rachel: I can't kiss anyone.
Monica: So I'm kissing everyone?
Joey: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Ross: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Chandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody
kiss me!
Joey: Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]
Ross: (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I
mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning
it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you
back.
Rachel: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
End(She sees Monica sneaking out) Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a
short break! (Runs out, knocking over the mike stand)
Rachel: (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
(Enter Chandler)
Chandler: What was that?
Ross: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Chandler: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
(Goes to the counter)
Joey: (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
Ross: Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I
just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Chandler: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian
nightmare. 
Ross: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Chandler: Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
(People turn to look)
Ross: (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Chandler: That's very funny. We done now?
Ross: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell
her how you feel?
Chandler: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my
mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Ross: Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his
finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)
That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
[Scene: The Coma Guy's Room, Monica bursts in, closely followed by Phoebe. There is no
sign of Coma Guy.  His bed is empty.]
Phoebe: Alright, whadyou do with him?
(There is the sound of a flushing toilet and Coma Guy emerges from the bathroom)
Monica: Oh! You're awake!
Phoebe: Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Coma Guy: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Monica: You look good!
Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?
Monica: Oh, sorry.
Phoebe: I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Monica: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Phoebe: Well, we both have.
Coma Guy: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Phoebe: Well, actually it's just from me.
Monica: I got you the foot massager.
Phoebe: You know who shaved you? That was me.
Monica: I read to you.
Phoebe: I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
Coma Guy: Well,... thanks.
Monica: Oh, my pleasure.
Phoebe: You're welcome.
Coma Guy: So. I guess I'll see you around.
Phoebe: What, that's it? 
Monica: "See you around?"
Coma Guy: Well, what do you want me to say?
Monica: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something
to me? "I'll call you?" 
Coma Guy: Alright, I'll call you.
Phoebe: I don't think you mean that.
Monica: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-
we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See
you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the
coma.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's Chandler is talking with his mom.]
Mrs. Bing: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of
my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Chandler: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Mrs. Bing: Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)
Chandler: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Mrs. Bing: (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Chandler: Really stupid.
Mrs. Bing: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry,
honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Chandler: Yeah. No. No...
[Cut to the hallway, Joey is listening to Chandler and his mom's conversation through
the door as Ross walks up.]
Ross: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Joey: Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about
everything.
Ross: You're kidding.
Joey: No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a
mom?"
Ross: Wow!
Joey: Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up
and realise I have a bomb?"
Ross: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna
grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Joey: That makes more sense.
Ross: So, what's going on now?
Joey: I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to
the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
Ross: Whaddya see?
Joey: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking
away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
(Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries Monica and Rachel's apartment, but it is
locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn't listening. Chandler and his
mom come out)
Mrs. Bing: You okay, kiddo?
Chandler: Yeah, okay.
Mrs. Bing: Alright. (Kisses him)
Chandler: Nice save.
(She walks down the hall)
Ross: (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
Mrs. Bing: Mr. Geller.
(She leaves)
(Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel's door)
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: You mean that?
Chandler: Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
Ross: Yeah? How'd it go?
Chandler: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
Ross: Well, howdya feel?
Chandler: Pretty good! I told her.
Ross: Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your
mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go
down that road.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is handing out copies of her book to the gang.]
Rachel: Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Monica: What's a 'niffle'?
Joey: You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Rachel: Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Ross: Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,
you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Rachel: Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
All: Nooo! 
End[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there. Ross working on
crossword puzzle, starts humming theme from The Odd Couple. Chandler joins in,
followed by Monica and Phoebe, then the whole gang. Ross starts humming theme from I
Dream Of Jeannie.]
Chandler: No-no-no-no, we're done.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone in the kitchen.]
Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told
me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on
phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
(Camera moves to Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, and Joey sitting in living room)
Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no
compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
Phoebe: Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually
eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)
Chandler: And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
Phoebe: (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)
Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me
to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt
Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
(Camera pans back to group in living room)
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?
(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like
voice) Hi Daddy! 
Ross: (waves) Hello!
Joey: (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause;
shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still
looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)
(Rachel enters with Paolo, speaking Italian. Ross looks annoyed)
Rachel: Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching
Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
Paolo: Ah, poke (Paolo touches Rachel's nose) a (touches nose again)
nose, mmm (they rub noses, then kisses her)
Joey, Chandler, and Ross: (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo)
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
(Camera pans to Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe in the kitchen)
Monica: So, did I hear Poconos?
Rachel: Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Phoebe: Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Monica: Yeah, that's a big step.
Rachel: I know...
(Camera pans to Ross, looking dejected)
Chandler: (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes
flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
(Camera pans back to Rachel)
Rachel: I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things
that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,
I'm totally, totally...
(Camera pans to Ross, holding his stomach)
Ross: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call
immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Joey leaving girls' apartment, carrying lasagna.]
Joey: I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,
and their little baby hands... 
Chandler: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
(Joey opens door, throws keys on kitchen table, table falls over)
Joey: Need a new table.
Chandler: You think?
[Scene: Carol and Susan's, there's a knock on the door and Carol answers it to Ross.]
Carol: Hey hey, come on in!
(Ross enters, carrying lasagna)
Ross: Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends
her love, along with this lasagna. 
Carol: Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Ross: (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
Carol: So, I got the results of the amnio today.
Ross: (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is
everything, uhh....? 
Carol: Totally and completely healthy!
Ross: Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a
picture frame)
Ross: Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Carol: Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Ross: (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend
Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)
Carol: Don't you want to know about the sex?
Ross: (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough
trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing
hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...
Carol: The sex of the baby, Ross.
Ross: Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Carol: Do you want to know?
Ross: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you
know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!
(pauses) Or isn't...
(Susan enters)
Susan: Oh, hello Ross!
Ross: Susan...
Susan: So, so, did you hear?
Ross: Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Susan: Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It
really is...do we know...?
Carol: Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Ross: (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy
who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Susan: Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Carol: Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out and
lightly taps Susan's shoulder)
Ross: Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? 
Carol and Susan: It's a...
Ross: (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to
know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. 
Carol: Well, thanks for the books.
Ross: No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,
then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)
Susan: All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
(intercom buzzer rings)
Carol: Hello?
Ross: (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and
Susan laugh)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's,  Joey and Chandler use their knees as a table to
support the lasagna.]
Chandler: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Joey: That's the rule.
Chandler: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Joey: How'd you get to that?
Chandler: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little
breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Joey: You knew about that?
Chandler: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left
little to the imagination.
Joey: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Chandler: What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Joey: Yeah
Chandler: You think we're ready for something like that?
Joey: Why not?
Chandler: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to
move out?
Joey: Why, are you moving out?
Chandler: I'm not moving out. 
Joey: You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Joey: Aw, I know all about Kip!
Chandler: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and
got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Joey: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Chandler: Aw, don't do that
[Scene: Phoebe's Massage Parlor, Phoebe's assistant is telling her about the changes to
her schedule.]
Phoebe's Assistant: We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your
4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30
shiatsu.
Phoebe: Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)
Phoebe's Assistant: Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but, yum (walks out, Paolo enters)
Paolo: Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Phoebe: Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Paolo: Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
Phoebe: Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
(Paolo speaks Italian)
Phoebe: Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Paolo: Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Phoebe: Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,
to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.]
Rachel: (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I
couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... 
Monica: And Monica knows...
Ross: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Monica: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Joey: So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and
waves arms frantically in protest)
Ross: Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Monica: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Joey: Or an uncle... 
(Phoebe enters)
Joey and Chandler: Hey Phoebe!
Ross: Hi Pheebs!
Rachel: Pheebs!
Phoebe: Fine!
Monica: Phoebe, what's the matter?
Phoebe: Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Customer: Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Rachel: Oh, right, that's me!
Joey: Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Chandler: Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
Monica: Phoebe, what is it?
Phoebe: All right, you know Paolo?
Ross: I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Phoebe: Well, he made a move on me.
(Joey and Chandler come back)

Chandler: More coffee over here, please!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Monica: Well, what happened?
Phoebe: Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
(A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)
[Cut back to Central Perk.]
Joey and Chandler:  Ooooohh!
Ross: My God.
Monica: Are you sure?
(The flashback resumes with Paolo grabbing her butt.)
[Cut back to Central Perk.]
Phoebe: Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.)
And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolo
rolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)
Monica: Was it...?
Phoebe: Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Guys: Oooooo....
(Rachel runs over)
Rachel: "Ooo," what?
Phoebe: Uma Thurman.
Monica: Oh!
Ross: The actress!
(all talking indistinctly, high-fiving)
Ross: Thanks Rach.
(Rachel walks away)
Chandler: So what are you gonna do?
Ross: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as
a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to
chime in)
Chandler: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Joey: Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Phoebe: She is gonna hate me.
Ross:(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...
[Scene: The Table Store, Joey and Chandler and looking for their new table.]
Joey: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a
table)
Chandler: That's patio furniture!
Joey: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside
again?" Of course!
Chandler: (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
Joey: I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat
something."
Chandler: You pick one.
Joey: All right, how about the ladybugs?
Chandler: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine
dining!
Joey: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Chandler: Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey
turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel folding and packing clothes in suitcases as Phoebe
enters.]
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe: Are you moving out?
Rachel: No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and
shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.
Phoebe: Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Rachel: Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Phoebe: Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um, 
Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Phoebe: Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a
time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are
the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal
raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)
Rachel: (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie,
overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Phoebe: Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other
cookies
Rachel: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've
ever had.
Phoebe: Which proves that I never lie.
Rachel: I guess you don't.
Phoebe: Paolo made a pass at me.
(Rachel looks stunned)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Chandler, Joey, and Monica admiring their new
table.]
Chandler: So, what do you think?
Ross: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Chandler: I know!
(The camera pans back to reveal Joey and Chandler's new foosball table.)
Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little
guys' heads?
Joey: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Monica: Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at
Chandler) You suck!
(Chandler looks at Joey in amazement)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is recovering from the shock.]
Phoebe: Are you okay?
Rachel: I need some milk.
Phoebe: Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup)
Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?
Rachel: No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other
day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel
so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Phoebe: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
(Phoebe's and Rachel's lines overlap)
Rachel: Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Rachel and Phoebe: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No
I'm sorry! 
Phoebe: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Rachel: I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Phoebe: Such a pig!
Rachel: Oh, God, he's such a pig, 
Phoebe: Oh he's like a...
Rachel: He's like a big disgusting... 
Phoebe: ...like a...
Rachel: ...pig...pig man!
Phoebe: Yes, good! Ok...
Rachel: (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Phoebe: (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's
gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Rachel: Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
Phoebe: The end.
Rachel: Oh, God...
Phoebe: Should I not have told you?
Rachel: No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just
liked it better before it was better...
(Phoebe scoots her chair over to Rachel and hugs her)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling everyone how it went across the hall as
the foosball game continues.]
Phoebe: I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,
so...
Monica: We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching
places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game!
Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
Ross: (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your
butts.
Joey: No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there
team.
Ross: Come on, two on one.
Chandler: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's
time for you to swoop in!
Ross: What, now?
Joey: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out
of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's
not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Chandler: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off
into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is throwing Paolo's clothes over the side.]
Paolo: No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
[Cut to inside the apartment.]
Ross: (entering) How's it going?
Monica: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in
front of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous
breasts!" Here he comes! 
Phoebe: Ooh!
(Paolo enters. Ross, Phoebe, and Monica scatter)
Paolo: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Phoebe: Oh, ok bye-bye.
Monica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a
lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Paolo: Grazie.
Ross: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I
say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
Phoebe: Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)
Ross: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's
not overwhelmed...
Monica: Oh, you're right.
Ross: (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
[Cut to the balcony, Ross has just climbed through the window.]
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hey.
Ross: You all right?
Rachel: Ooh, I've been better...
Ross: Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than
him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he
has you.
Rachel: Oh, Ross...
Ross: What?
Rachel: I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want
to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)
Ross: Huh.
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great!
Ross: Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
[Cut to inside the apartment, Rachel and Ross are entering.]
Monica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Rachel: Oh...
Phoebe: You ok?
Rachel: ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Phoebe: Yep!
Ross: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the
answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated
screening process.
Rachel: No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to
figure out what I want
Ross: Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Rachel: No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up
to be one.
Ross: (astonished) What? 
Rachel: What?
Ross: I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Rachel: Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
Girls: Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)
Ross: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
(Joey and Chandler run in)
Chandler: Wha-
Joey: Wha-
Joey and Chandler: What is it?
Ross: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey and Chandler: We already knew that! (they hug)
Ross: I'm having a son. Um...
(Ross looks scared)
Closing Credits
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Monica is busy killing Chandle and Joey at foosball.]
Monica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Joey and Chandler: Shut-out!! (They both start heading for
their rooms.)
Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Joey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Chandler: Yeah, get out!
Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use
my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I
gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
Chandler: (to Joey) One more game?
Joey: Oh yeah!
EndEnd[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is eyeing a beautiful woman at the counter, and Joey and
Chandler are egging him on to go talk to her. No pun intended. I mean it.]
Joey: I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Ross: She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Chandler: Any contact?
Ross: She lent me an egg once.
Joey: You're in!
Ross: Aw, right.
Woman: Hi, Ross.
Ross: Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
Chandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel
thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third... 
Joey: Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Ross: An egg?
Joey: Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm
returning your egg."
Chandler: I think it's winning.
Ross: I think it's insane.
Chandler: She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
(Ross walks over to the woman, egg in hand.)
Joey: Think it'll work?
Chandler: No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler are there. Ross is still
talking to the beautiful woman.]
Monica: You can not do this.
Rachel: Do what, do what?
Monica: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Rachel: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Phoebe: 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,
still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Monica: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I
know I do. 
Rachel: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Chandler: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Joey: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out
with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Chandler: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Joey: Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's
vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and
eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'
this.
Ross: Hi. She said yes.
Chandler: Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in
Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
[Scene: A Restaurant, Joey and Chandler are there, waiting for their dates to show up.]
Joey: (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
Chandler: Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,
no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Chandler: ...And what did you bring?
Lorraine: She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my
hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Chandler: Janice?
(Lorraine leaves. Joey shakes his head as though to say, 'It can't be the same Janice.'
Janice enters.)
Janice: Oh.... my.... God.
Chandler: (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
[Scene: The bathroom at the restaurant, Chandler and Joey are talking.]
Chandler: Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. 
Joey: No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with
Lorraine. Just calm down. 
Chandler: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped
twice in the last five months!
Joey: (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I
can't go when I'm nervous.
Chandler: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and
yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with
men.]
Rachel: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Monica: Which one was Pete Carney?
Rachel: Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had
sex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?"
Monica: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over
Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with
the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.
Rachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Monica: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Phoebe: I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Monica: There's more beer, right?
Phoebe: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you
want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Rachel: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Phoebe: Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.
Monica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Phoebe: Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Rachel: Or?
Phoebe: Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Monica: Burning's good.
Rachel: Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
[Scene: The Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table. Joey and
Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one
another.]
Lorraine: You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters
with my toes.
Joey: Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Janice: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want,
I have a bag with just your heads.
Chandler: That's OK.
Janice: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little
puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
(Lorraine whispers into Joey's ear.)
Joey: (to Lorraine) We can't do that.
Chandler: (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
Joey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
(Chandler and Joey leave the table.)
Joey: Uh, we might be leaving now.
Chandler: Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Joey: She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm
not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Chandler: Ok, you can not do this to me.
Joey: You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Lorraine: (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
Joey: I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,
Chandler.
Chandler: I hope she throws up on you.
(Joey leaves with Lorraine. Chandler sits back down with Janice.)
Chandler: So...
Janice: Just us.
Chandler: Oh, what a crappy night!
Janice: Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin'
outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. 
Chandler: Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...
other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
Janice: So, do we have the best friends or what?
Chandler: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Janice: I will go for that drink.
Chandler: You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we
get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Janice: Each.
Chandler: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always
wanted to know...
[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Chandler wakes up, and finds someone else's hand on his
chest. He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there.]
Janice: Happy Valentine's Day!
Commercial Break
[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler is trying to get Janice out of his apartment.]
Janice: Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Chandler: No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Janice: Kiss me!
(Janice kisses him. Monica comes out for the newspaper.}
Monica: Oh, Chandler, sorry.
(Janice turns around, Monica sees who it is.)
Monica: Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Janice: Hi, Monica.
Chandler: Ok, well, this was very special.
Monica: Rach, come see who's out here!
(Rachel comes out.)
Rachel: Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Chandler: Janice is gonna go away now.
Monica: I'll be right back.
(Joey enters from the stairs.)
Rachel: Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Joey: (in disbelief) Whoa.
Chandler: Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Janice: This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
(Monica comes out with her cordless phone.)
Monica: Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to
Chandler) He just happened to call.
Janice: Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously) 
[Scene: A Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date.]
Ross: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole
um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los
Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
(Ross starts to laugh, and then makes a face like 'Why did I just say that?' Ross'
ex-wife, Carol, and her lesbian lover, Susan, enter the restaurant. Ross stares at them.)
Kristin: That's funny. Who are they?
Ross: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,
personal friend.
Kristin: You mean they're lovers.
Ross: If you wanna put a label on it.
Kristin: Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Ross: Nope, nope, that's it. 
(Carol takes off her jacket, her pregnant belly is exposed.)
Ross: Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol
and Susan) Helloo!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire.]
Phoebe: Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Monica: All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Phoebe: Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.
Rachel: Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the
ritual in the first place.
Monica: Can we just start throwing things in?
Phoebe: Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.
Rachel: (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer
shorts.
Phoebe: Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Monica: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Rachel: (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Monica: No.
Rachel and Phoebe: Eww!
Rachel: And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Monica: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
(Rachel throws the alcohol in the fire. A burst of flames shoots up from it.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Chandler is preparing to dump Janice
again.]
Chandler: How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Joey: I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Chandler: Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
(Janice enters.)
Janice: Hello, funny Valentine.
Chandler: Hi, Just Janice.
Janice: Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and
I'm gonna!
(Janice kisses Joey all over. Chandler smiles.)
Joey: (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.
[Scene: The Chinese Restaurant.]
Ross: So, um, what do you do for a living?
Kristin: Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching
Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left
stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Carol: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 
Susan: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)
Ross: Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. 
Kristin: (reluctantly) I guess.
Ross: Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Carol: Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Ross: Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's
try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,
funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, firemen are there to handle the bonfire that got out of
control.]
Fireman No. 1: What do we got there?
Fireman No. 2: A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what
looks like a half-charred picture—Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Monica: You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Fireman No. 3: It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This
isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
Fireman No. 1: You're our third call tonight.
Rachel: Really?
Fireman No. 2: Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
[Scene: Central Perk.]
Janice: I brought you something.
Chandler: Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and
Jan Forever.
Janice: I had them made special.
Chandler: Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell
you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things
are gonna work out.
Janice: That's fine.
Chandler: (surprised) It is?
Janice: Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Chandler: Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Janice: No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet?
You love me, Chandler Bing.
Chandler: Oh, no I don't.
Janice: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up
together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? 
Chandler: I did, but...
Janice: You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a
foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know
it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
(She kisses him passionately,then leaves.)
Chandler: Call me!
[Scene: The Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there.]
Carol: It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Ross: You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long
has she been in the bathroom?
Carol: Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Ross: Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had
in 9 years. 
Carol: That could be it.
Ross: Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still
pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off
and eats it.)
Carol: Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay
through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
Ross: No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life"
thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and
she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin'
to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know,
here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know
what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for
now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.
You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,
you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
(They kiss.)
Carol: Oh, I love you too. But...
Ross: No but, no but.
Carol: You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to
take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting
for you.
Ross: That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Carol: All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
(A beautiful woman walks by Ross, he stares at her.)
Carol: Not her.

them!

End(Ursula Buffay, Phoebe’s identical twin sister, is waiting on tables in her
inimitable manner.)

Joey: There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
(Ursula spins around looking puzzled, quite unable to tell where the sound is coming
from.)

Chandler: It’s Phoebe! Hi!
(Ursula notices Joey waving his hand, and comes over.)

Ursula: Hi. Okay, will that be all?

Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?

Ursula: Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello
Miss," so now I’m here.

Joey: No, no... how come you are working here?

Ursula: Right, yeah, ’cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are
really cute.

Chandler: Can we start over?

Ursula: Yeah. Okay great. I’m gonna be over here. (She wanders away.)

Chandler and Joey: No, no, no!
Opening Credits
[Scene: A wintry February day in New York City, snowplows are clearing the streets.
Inside Central Perk, all three girls are paying court to Ross.]

Ross: I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but my
monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine,
"supposedly" by accident.

Rachel: No, yeah, I’ve done that.

Ross: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and
peed all over the crossword.

Rachel: I’ve never done that.
(Outside in the street, Joey and Chandler arrive, to peer through the window at Phoebe,
by bending down to look underneath the shop’s sign—a large steaming cup of
coffee.)

Chandler: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like
her sister.

Joey: I’m sayin’ I see a difference.

Chandler: They’re twins!

Joey: I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!
(Joey and Chandler come indoors.)

Chandler: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?

Joey: Yeah.

Chandler: Let’s not do that any more.
(They hang up their coats and scarves, then approach their friends on the main sofa.)

All: Hey guys! Hey!

Joey: Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.

Phoebe: Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.

Joey: Nope.

Phoebe: Morly Safer.

Joey: Nope.

Phoebe: The woman who cuts my hair!

Monica: Okay, look, this could be a really long game.

Chandler: Your sister Ursula.

Phoebe: (Her face dropping) Oh, really.

Chandler: Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...

Phoebe: Rift’s. Yeah, I know.

Chandler: Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.

Phoebe: Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?

Joey: Not from where I was standin’.

Phoebe: (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?

Rachel: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?

Phoebe: It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone
always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to
start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it
was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"

Ross: Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.

Chandler: Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.

Rachel: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?

Ross: No, Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads, we’ve got
lesbians, the whole parenting team.

Rachel: Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird?

Ross: No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta been
at first, but by now I, I think I’m pretty comfortable with the whole situation.

Monica: Ross, that’s my jacket.

Ross: I know.
(Rachel grins as Ross removes the girlie jacket, grabs his own, and rushes out.)
[Scene: The Lamaze class, several couples and one trio sit on the floor, introducing
themselves to the teacher, who’s got as far as a woman sitting next to Ross, Carol,
and Susan.]

Woman: Hi, we’re the Rostins. Err, I’m J.C., and he’s Michael, and
we’re having a boy, and a girl.

Teacher: Good for you. Alrighty, next?

Ross: Hi, um, I’m err, (has to clear his throat) I’m Ross Geller, and err
ah... (pats Carol’s bulge) ..that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh,
(points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s,
just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent
until) ..who’s next?

Teacher: I’m sorry, I didn’t get... Susan is?

Ross: Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend...

Carol: Life partner.

Ross: Like buddies.

Susan: Like lovers.

Ross: You know how close women can get.
(The teacher smiles, but her eyebrows go up. Susan and Carol pat each other
affectionately.)

Carol: Susan and I live together.

Ross: Although I was married to her.

Susan: Carol, not me.

Ross: Err, right.

Carol: It’s a little complicated.

Ross: A little.

Susan: But we’re fine.

Ross: Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah!
That’s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.
[Scene : Chandler's Office, Chandler is working.]
(Helen’s buzzer is heard on the intercom, so Chandler presses his button, too.)

Chandler: And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.

Helen: (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

Chandler: Oh, okay. Send her in.
(He hurriedly checks his hair in his computer screen, before taking a sporting trophy
from a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. An attractive young woman opens the
door.)

Nina: Hi.

Chandler: Hi, Nina. Come on in.

Nina: You wanted to see me?

Chandler: Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little
thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.

Nina: Which is bad, because?

Chandler: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.

Nina: Your... excuse me?

Chandler: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...

Nina: Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won’t happen again. I
wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
(Nina beams flirtatiously at Chandler, who catches her drift, but for once he’s
lost for something to say &ndash; so she nods her head to tell him that he’s
thinking correctly...)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Chandler, and the girls are dividing some Chinese
takeout, while the sitcom Family Matters is playing on the TV.]

Chandler: It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that...
she’s really really cute.

Ross: It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.
(Marcel scampers about, interfering with the neatness.)

Monica: Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again.

Ross: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the
remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
(Marcel points the remote at Monica’s television, pressing a particular
combination of keys. The logo SAP appears on the screen, and suddenly the dialogue is
dubbed into Spanish.)

Monica: Great.

Ross: Relax, I’ll fix it.

Rachel: (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is
"Urkel."

Ross: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?

Chandler: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the
Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
(Rachel slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their
welcome.)

Monica: Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New
Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.

Rachel: Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the
lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica’s note
stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?
(Joey enters, looking extremely pleased with himself.)

Chandler: Hey, where you been?

Joey: I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was
coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four
plates of curly fries.

Chandler: Score.

Joey: She is so hot!

Chandler: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run
it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)

Joey: Pheebs?

Phoebe: (Jumping up) Yeah?

Joey: You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?

Phoebe: Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?

Joey: So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there.

Phoebe: Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um...
I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart,
so, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay.

Joey: Cool, thanks.
(He happily gestures at Chandler that there was nothing to worry about, then exits.
Rachel and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross.)

Ross: You okay?

Phoebe: Yeah I’m fine.

Ross: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
(The sitcom begins with its familiar refrain, yet with a Latin lilt. Rachel and Monica
do a little dance with their chopsticks, and Phoebe has to grin as Ross joins in the
rhythm.)
[Scene: Lamaze class. Susan is there. Each couple has a doll, for they have just
finished learning how to change a diaper. As Ross rushes in, stepping on the Rostins’
pretend baby, squashing its head flat. It bleats, in protest. He performs emergency
surgery, then hands the doll back to J.C.]

Ross: Sorry.

Ross: Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?

Susan: Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I’ll get the
information.

Ross: No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know
what’s going on.

Susan: Oh, good. This’ll be fun.

Teacher: Alrighty. We’re gonna start with some basic third stage breathing
exercises, so Mummies, why don’t you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be
supporting Mummy’s head.
(Ross and Susan each gesture for the other to lie down.)

Ross and Susan: What? What? What?

Susan: I am supposed to be the mommy?

Ross: Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.

Susan: Look, I don’t see why I should have to miss out on the coaching
training just because I’m a woman.

Ross: I see. So what do you propose to do?

Susan: I will flip you for it.

Ross: Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!

Susan: (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom.
(Ross gets down like all the other mothers, cradled in Susan’s lap like all the
other fathers.)

Teacher: Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
(Forgetting herself, Susan does the "Mommy" action with Ross.)

Teacher: Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
(Ross comes out of character to glare into the distance.)
[Scene: Chandler's Office. Chandler is playing with a toy as his boss Mr. Douglas
knocks and opens the door.]

Chandler: Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?

Mr. Douglas: Ohh, it’s been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.

Chandler: And?

Mr. Douglas: It’s pretty ugly. We haven’t seen an ANUS this bad since the
seventies.

Chandler: So what does this mean?

Mr. Douglas: Well, we’re gonna be layin’ off people in every department.

Chandler: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my
hair was very very &ndash;

Mr. Douglas: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
[Scene: Chandler's Office, later that day, Nina is in his office.]

Chandler: Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In
pain) Nina.
(She sympathetically reaches out to fondle the inner thigh of his left leg.)

Nina: Are you okay?

Chandler: (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I
called you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.

Nina: (Taking her hand away) What?

Chandler: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
(Nina gasps in surprise and relief.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is at the counter, serving coffee to Phoebe.]

Rachel: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?

Phoebe: Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.

Rachel: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?

Phoebe: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.

Rachel: Ooh, okay... good.
(Jamie Buchman and Fran Devanow enter the coffee house. They look about them as Jamie
removes her coat and scarf.)

Jamie: What is this place?

Fran: Look, you’re cold, I have to pee, and... (indicating the sign)
..there’s a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
(Jamie notices Phoebe sitting at the counter.)

Jamie: I think we have an answer.

Fran: What’s she doing here?

Jamie: This could be God’s way of telling us to eat at home.

Fran: Think she got fired at Riff’s?

Jamie: No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory)
..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies’ bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?

Fran: I’m gonna wait till after we order. It’s her, right.

Jamie: It looks like her.
(Phoebe walks by, ignoring the two strangers.)

Jamie: Um, excuse me.

Phoebe: Yeah?

Jamie: Hi, it’s us.

Phoebe: (Smiling blankly) Right, and it’s me.

Jamie: So, so you’re here too?

Phoebe: Much as you are.

Jamie: (Without moving her lips) Your turn.

Fran: Err... we know what we want.

Phoebe: (Philosophically) Oh, that’s good.

Jamie: All we want is two Caffe Lattes.

Fran: And some biscottie cookies.

Phoebe: Good choice.
(Phoebe turns away so that the two weird women won’t see the face she pulls, and
sits down.)

Jamie: Definitely her.

Fran: Yeah.
Commercial break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Phoebe is watching a Spanish version
of The Waltons. At a nearby table sit Monica knitting, Rachel winding a ball of wool, and
Chandler supplying them both from a skein which is spread between his hands.]
(Phoebe uses the remote to stop the Spanish by turning off the television.)

Monica: I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she
doesn’t have a job yet?

Chandler: Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.

Monica: Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest
argument.

Chandler: I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?

Rachel: Oh, well, that shouldn’t be so hard, now that you’re dating.
(Imitating men at their worst) "Sweetheart, you’re fired, but how ’bout a
quickie before I go to work?"
(Joey lets himself in, carrying a large paper shopping bag.)

Joey: Hey.

Rachel and Chandler: Hey.
(There is a loud knocking at the door through which Joey has just entered.)

Chandler: You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.

Monica: I’ll get it.
(She rises, dragging Chandler along by the wool. Rachel has to leap over a chair to
follow them. Monica opens the door to find Mr. Heckles standing there.)

Monica: Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.

Mr.Heckles: You’re doing it again.

Monica: We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking,
quietly.

Mr.Heckles: I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can’t sleep.

Rachel: You don’t even have cats.

Mr.Heckles: I could have cats.

Monica: (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.

Rachel: We’ll try to keep it down.
(The wool-bound trio returns to the table. Rachel has to rush ahead to avoid becoming
tangled. Joey brings the shopping bag over to Phoebe, and takes out a nice cardigan.)

Joey: Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make
sure it fits.

Phoebe: Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in
her lap) ..oh, this is really...

Joey: Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.

Phoebe: Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag)
..okay, it fits.
(The others have been taking all this in.)

Rachel: Are you seein’ her again tonight?

Joey: Yep. Ice Capades.

Chandler: Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind
of capade.

Joey: I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’s
uh, somethin’ about her.

Phoebe: That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knitting
circle) we get it. You like her. Great!
(The circle freezes in apprehension.)

Joey: Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.

Phoebe: Alright, well, maybe now it’s not okay.

Joey: Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay.

Phoebe: Okay.
(An embarrassed silence... finally broken by)

Chandler: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
(Monica frantically bursts into action as Rachel resumes winding, tangling
Chandler’s wool.)
[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler & Nina are locked in a passionate embrace.
Someone knocks, so they hurriedly separate to stare out of the window. Chandler’s
boss opens the door.]

Chandler: And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.

Mr. Douglas: Nina.

Nina: Mr.Douglas... (flirting defensively) ..cool tie.
(She escapes, fortunately so distracting Mr. Douglas, that he misses Chandler’s
expression of alarm & guilt.)

Mr. Douglas: (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Nina’s shapely
departure) She’s still here.

Chandler: Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go,
err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan. 
(Thinking quickly, Chandler desperately tries to remember anything to do with
schizophrenia....) 

Chandler: And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact,
he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.

Mr. Douglas: You’re kidding? She seems so...

Chandler: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is
whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no
recollection of being fired at all, none at all.

Mr. Douglas: That’s unbelievable.

Chandler: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be
assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.

Mr. Douglas: I see. I guess you never really know what’s goin’ on inside
a person’s head.

Chandler: Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.
(Mr. Douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what Bing has just said, but turning
to follow Nina down the corridor, he realises Bing must be telling the truth, since he
would not have any personal interest in the girl, would he?)
[Scene: Lamaze class, Ross is again on the floor, cradled in Susan’s lap, but now
Carol is cradled in his lap, and she has a pretend baby, on her lap. The teacher is
showing her class a video, which is about to end.]

Soothing male voice: ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the
miracle of birth.

Teacher: Lights please? And that’s having a baby. Next week is our final
class.
(People start getting up. Ross grabs Carol’s doll to hold it upside down like a
football, slapping it with his other hand.)

Ross: Susan, go deep.
(Susan just glares back, as Ross’s inappropriate joke falls flat. Meanwhile, a
bubble is about to burst...)

Carol: This is impossible. It’s just impossible.

Susan: What is, honey?

Carol: What that woman... did. I am not doin’ that. It’s just
gonna have to stay in, that’s all, everything will be the same, it’ll just stay in.

Ross: Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s gonna be alright.

Carol: (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know?  No one's going up to you and
saying, "Hi, is that your nostril?  Mind if we push this pot roast
through it?"

Susan: Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
(Both women gulp in air. Ross looks at his "football," then manipulates the
head & limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents.)

Susan: I know it’s frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one
day, and when it’s over, we’re all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
(Ross is staring blankly into space.)

Susan: I mean, that’s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
[Scene 13: Central Perk, the gang is gathered around Monica comforting her brother, who
in a slight state of shock is cuddling a cushion for security.]

Ross: I’m gonna be a father.

Rachel: This is just occurring to you?

Ross: I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was
having me.

Rachel: (She comforts him too) Oh, you’re gonna be great!

Ross: Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the
bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?

Chandler: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and
babies are actually different.
(Joey tires of this, so he gets up to leave.)

Phoebe: Where’re you going?

Joey: Out.

Phoebe: With?

Joey: (Spreading his arms wide) Yes.

Phoebe: Alright, could I just ask you one question?
(Joey nods his head.)

Phoebe: Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?

Joey: Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t,
okay?
(Joey walks toward the door, then hesitates and turns back.)

Joey: You meant sex, right?
(Phoebe buttons her lip, while the rest of the gang pretend they’re not there.)
[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler is working as Nina knocks, then opens the door.]

Nina: Do you have a sec?

Chandler: Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?

Nina: I don’t know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding
me and giving me these really strange looks.

Chandler: Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of
us.

Nina: Maybe. But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors.

Chandler: Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.

Nina: I am?

Chandler: Sure, why not?

Nina: Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You’re amazing!

Chandler: Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure
we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?

Helen: (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile
to Personnel?

Nina: What?

Chandler: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
(Nina puts her hands on her hips, then gives Chandler a quizzical look.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are sharing a bowl
of popcorn, while Monica carefully reads the instruction manual for her television set.]

Chandler: Well, I ended up telling her everything.

Rachel: Oh, how’d she take it?

Chandler: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.)
Little tip: if you’re ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your
hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.

Monica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.
(Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book,
but the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.)

Phoebe: Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go
away? Because I can’t, I can’t watch.

Monica: (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they’re gone.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Are you alright?

Phoebe: Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid Ursula
thing, it’s...

Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it
really so terrible?

Phoebe: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or
anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was
eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the
bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a
boyfriend who was like your best friend?

Monica and Rachel: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.

Phoebe: Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole
him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me
any more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked
like either one of us.

Rachel: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.

Phoebe: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...

Chandler: You’re not gonna lose him.

Monica: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.

Phoebe: Yeah. Okay.

Ross: No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.

Phoebe: But he’s falling in love with her.

Rachel: Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slept
together yet, I mean, that’s not serious.

Phoebe: Okay... Okay.
(Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now.)

Phoebe: Oh, okay, oh.
(Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joey’s
apartment is shut. She knocks, and anxiously waits for Joey to come, but instead her
identical twin sister emerges wearing one of Joey’s shirts.)

Ursula: (Surprised) Oh.
(Phoebe reels back in shock, while Ursula defiantly leans against the doorpost as
though she owns the place.)

Ursula: Yeah, um, may we help you?
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is taking down the Christmas lights. Monica
sees her, so she leans out of the small side window.]

Monica: Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come
back inside?

Rachel: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the
railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? Whoa!
(Screams.)
(Rachel slips, loses her balance, and falls over the edge..)

Monica: Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!
(In the apartment below, Mr.Heckles is trying to relax and read his newspaper, but
Rachel is helplessly dangling upside-down with her ankle wrapped up in the Christmas
lights.)

Rachel: (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's
window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?

Mr.Heckles: See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
End(The whole gang is helping Rachel mail out resumes while whistling the theme from The
Bridge on the River Kwai.)
Ross: Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Monica: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Chandler: Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work
for.
Rachel: Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a
waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse
me...'
Ross: Rach, did you proofread these?
Rachel: Uh... yeah, why?
Ross: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper
skills.
Rachel: (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
Joey: Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are sitting at a table. Rachel is working.
Monica and Phoebe enter.]
Monica: Hey, guys.
Chandler and Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly):
Did you bring the mail?
Monica: Lots of responses.
Rachel: (to Monica): Really? (out loud): Sure, we have scones left! (to Monica):
OK, read them to me.
Phoebe: (reading): Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
(crumples up letter)
Rachel: (out loud): We have apple cinnamon...
Monica: (reading): OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpes
up letter)
Phoebe: Wow!
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: (reading): Your Visa bill is huge!
Rachel: (grabs the bill) Give me that!
(Camera cuts to Chandler and Ross at table.)
Chandler: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out
with her again?
Ross: I don't know.
Chandler: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really
happened' thing?
Ross: No, it's not just that. It's just—I want someone who... who does
something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins
to stare lovingly at Rachel)
Chandler: ...little playthings with yarn?
Ross: What?
Chandler: Could you want her more?
Ross: Who?
Chandler: (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Ross: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over,
Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!
Rachel: Hi! How are you?
Ross: We're fine, we're fine.
Rachel: OK. (walks away) 
(Ross keeps staring at her, head on table. Chandler smacks him with a newspaper. Joey
enters, Ross and Chandler laugh at him.)
Joey: Shut up!
Chandler: We're not—we're not saying anything.
Phoebe: What?
Ross: Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Joey: Thank you.
Chandler: (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
Joey: There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Ross: Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Chandler: And then he did.
Rachel: Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Phoebe: Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of
sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Ross: No, women are welcome to play.
Phoebe: Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some
kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Chandler: There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Joey: Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Girls: Oh, yeah, right.
Monica: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Rachel: Really.
Monica: I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Ross: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Girls: No.
Rachel: But you could teach us.
Guys: No.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.]
Chandler: (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
Monica: So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Rachel: Oh, good for you!
Phoebe: Congratulations!
(Microwave timer goes off. Monica gets up.)
Chandler: OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Phoebe: OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Ross: No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't—you can't do...
Rachel: Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)

Ross: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Rachel: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for
fours.
Ross: Oh, you're... (gives up)
(Monica comes back to the table with plates of food.)
Monica: Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Phoebe and Rachel: OOooooo!
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You
can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or
pretz...(look of realization)
Chandler: (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Monica: Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High
stakes... big bucks...
Ross: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they
didn't look happy...
Phoebe: But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Chandler: OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two
cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the
cards.
(Time lapse.)
Monica: (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Phoebe: (to Joey): Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Joey: About what?
Phoebe: About how good your cards were.
Joey: Heh... I was bluffing.
Phoebe: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Rachel: OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before
work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)
Guys: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Chandler: Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Rachel: Settle what?
Chandler: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us
the land, so...
Ross: The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Rachel: Oh. Right.
Joey: You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget
about the money, alright?
Monica: Hell no, we'll pay!
Phoebe: OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Monica: And you know what? We want a rematch.
Ross: Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Rachel: (to Ross): So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of
your friends.
Ross: (pause)...Yeah.
Chandler: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them
together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Ross: Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to
win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to
be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
Joey: (pause)...Yeah?
Ross: I'm not a nice guy.
[Scene: Ross' apartment. Chandler and Joey are there. Ross enters with a pizza.]
Ross: Alright boys, let's eat.
Chandler: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Ross: You still on that?
Chandler: Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking):
"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Ross: You are way off, pal.
Joey: No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Ross: Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not any
more. I just—I...
(Marcel makes a screeching noise in background.)
Ross: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
(Marcel puts a CD in the player.)
Ross: You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that
button, you are in very, very big trouble.
(The Lion Sleeps Tonight starts to play. Marcel starts to dance.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe are there.]
Rachel: (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Monica: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Phoebe: Ha. Ha, ha.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Monica: Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Rachel: Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Monica: That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate
slipped out of my hand.
Rachel: Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): Oh! I got an interview! I got an
interview!
Monica: You're kidding! Where? Where?
Rachel: (in disbelief): Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Monica: Oh, Rachel!
Phoebe: Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Monica: Well, what's the job?
Rachel: Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
(Knock on door.)
Monica: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she
was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
Aunt Iris: Is Tony Randall dead?
Rachel: No.
Monica: I don't think so.
Rachel: Why?
Aunt Iris: Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Monica: What?
Rachel: Oh my God!
Monica: Really?
Aunt Iris: No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me
tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe): Nice
earrings.
Phoebe: Thank y... (thinks about it)
Aunt Iris: Girls, sit down.
Monica: Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Aunt Iris: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's
do it.
[Scene: Ross's apartment, everyone but Rachel is seated around his table. The Lion
Sleep Tonight plays in the background.]
Phoebe: Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Ross: Alright.
(Ross shuts off the CD player. Marcel runs into the bedroom and slams the door.)
Ross: I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
(Knock on door. Ross opens it. Rachel enters.)
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Chandler: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all
recommending Trident?
Rachel: Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked
for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and—oh, I went to
camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
All: That's great! That's wonderful!
Rachel: Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Monica: OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Joey: Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to
play, we completely understand.
Chandler: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't
know... Pictionary?
(The guys all duck under the table.)
Monica: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker
another try. Shall we, ladies?
Phoebe and Rachel: Yes, we should. I think we should.
Ross: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Rachel: No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Ross: Alright.
Rachel: Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]
Ross: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen
big ones.
Joey: But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play
that at our regular game.
Phoebe: Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should
know that this money is cursed.
Joey: What?
Phoebe: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Chandler: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way
I can break 'em up with a movie.
Ross: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Rachel: Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I
have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)
Monica: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will
win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last
dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Rachel: Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there ready for another poker game.]
Ross: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing.
Rachel: Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Monica: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Phoebe: (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,
the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.
(Ross gets up from the table.)
Monica: Excuse me, where are you going?
Ross: Uh... to the bathroom.
Monica: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Ross: I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
Joey: Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)
Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store
closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Joey: That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Monica: Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
Phoebe: (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
(Ross comes back from bathroom.)
Ross: Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green.
Rachel: Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)
(Time lapse.)
Phoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'
Coincidence?
Chandler: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Joey: Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)
Rachel: I'm in.
Monica: Me too.
Joey: Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Ross: Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down
cards)
Rachel: Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down
cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna
make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I
think—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing): Well, I have got your
money, and you'll never see it...
(Ross stands up.)
Rachel: And your fly's still open...
(Ross looks down.)
Rachel: Ha, I made you look.... 
(Time lapse.)
Rachel: I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Phoebe: Monica, in or out?
Monica: (slams down cards) I hate this game! 
(Joey slides a plate away from Monica towards Chandler, who hides it under the table.)
Phoebe: OK Joey, your bet.
Joey: Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy
with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.
Phoebe: Ross?
Ross: Oh, I am very in.
Phoebe: Chandler?
Chandler: Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
Phoebe: Me too. Rachel.
Rachel: Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do
you say... want to waste another buck?
Ross: No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?
Rachel: I'm not telling. (collects chips)
Ross: Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)
Rachel: No..!
Ross: Show them to me!
Rachel: Get your hands out of there! No!
Ross: Let me see! Show them!
Chandler: Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Rachel: (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your
whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Phoebe: Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
(Ross is visibly upset.)
Ross: First of all, I'm not losing...
Rachel: Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)
Ross: Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Rachel: (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Ross: (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Rachel: (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.
(Rachel walks into kitchen to talk on the phone.)
Rachel: Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand.
Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if
anything else opens up, plea—Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)
(Rachel goes back and sits down. The rest don't know what to say.)
Monica: Sorry, Rach.
Phoebe: Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Rachel: Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh...
jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Joey: Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Rachel: Yes, we do. (pause)
Monica: Alright, check.
Joey: Check.
Ross: I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
Chandler: Call.
Phoebe: I'm in.
Rachel: I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it
in)
Ross: I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Rachel: Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does
anybody have a problem with that?
(Everyone says no and folds, except for Ross, who thinks about it.)
Rachel: (to Ross): Loser?
(Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe back their chairs away from the table.)
Ross: No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
Rachel: What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that
'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
(Ross thinks it over, finally sits down and picks up his cards.)
Ross: I'm in. (throws in chips)
Rachel: How many you want?
Ross: One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
Rachel: Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
Ross: I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
Rachel: OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)
Ross: I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)
(The other four look amazed at the large pot.)
Rachel: See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
(Monica gets up, looks in Rachel's purse.)
Monica: Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Rachel: OK, then get me your purse.
(Monica gets Rachel her purse.)
Monica: OK, here you go. Good luck.
Rachel: (to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raise
you... seven.
Phoebe: ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
(Ross looks in his wallet, pulls out two dollars.)
Ross: (to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy.
Joey: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
(Ross looks at Joey, dumbfounded at his stupidity.)
Chandler: (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?
Ross: Fifteen.
Chandler: Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
Joey: Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)
Ross: Thank you.
Chandler: Good luck.
Ross: (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
(Long pause as they both look at each other.)
Rachel: (lays down cards) Full house.
(Ross stares at her. Thinks about it. Puts cards on table, face down.)
Ross: You got me.
(Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and
singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)
Joey: (to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Chandler: (to Ross): I thought we had them!
Ross: Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you
know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)
(Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross's hand to
see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.)
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, all six are playing Pictionary at Monica's
apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what
looks like an airplane.]
Chandler: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport
'77! Airport '79!
(Timer goes off.)
Rachel: Oh, time's up.
Monica: (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Joey: Oh!
Phoebe: That's a bird?
(Monica glares at Phoebe.)
Phoebe: That's a bird!
(Monica sits, Rachel gets up.)
Rachel: OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)
Chandler: Go.
(Rachel starts drawing what looks like a bean.)
Ross: Uh.... bean! Bean!
(Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.)
Joey: (triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Rachel: Yes!
Monica: That, you get? That, you get?
(Monica picks up a glass to take a drink, everyone ducks as though she was about to
throw it.)

End[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is talking to a customer.]
Rachel: Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon
Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon
Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica enters with some mail.]
Monica: Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Rachel: Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Monica: Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Rachel: Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Monica: What is it?
Rachel: Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for
'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Monica: Barry who you almost...?
Rachel: Barry who I almost.
Monica: And Mindy, your maid of...?
Rachel: Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Monica: (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky.
To have had a friend like you.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are eating Chinese.]
Ross: Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good
boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see
he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel
ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Rachel: What?
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I
should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Ross: Really.
Rachel: No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Ross: Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with
men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Rachel: Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right
guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With
Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Ross: Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Rachel: Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's
like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Ross: Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone
who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
(Enter the other four)
Monica: Hi.
Ross: ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Rachel: Hi, how was the movie?
Monica: Wonderful!
Phoebe: So good!
Joey: Suck-fest.
Chandler: Toootal chick-flick.
Phoebe: I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and
bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Joey: Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a
little nudity.
Monica: There was nudity!
Joey: I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou
Grant frolicking.
Monica and Phoebe: Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Ross: Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Chandler: They're still just friends, right?
Rachel: (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
Ross: That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Monica: Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ross: 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be
there.
[Scene: Joe-G's Pizza, the guys are there.]
Chandler: I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Joey: I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Chandler: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they
would've happened already?
Ross: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone
exactly like me.
Joey: She really said that?
Ross: Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for
someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Joey: 'Tonight' tonight?
Ross: Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she
spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Chandler: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Ross: Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over
there and, uh, try to woo her.
Chandler: Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the
1890's, when that phrase was last used.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a
soap opera.]
Rachel: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used
to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.
Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with
Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the
shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the
newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.
Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment
holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out
in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?
Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the
open door)
[Time lapse. Now everyone but Ross and Phoebe is back at Monica and Rachel's.]
Joey: How could you lose him?
Rachel: I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Monica: Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Rachel: I don't know. The left one.
Monica: Which ones?
Rachel: Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Phoebe: (Entering) Hey. 
All: Hi.
Phoebe: Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Chandler: Rachel lost Marcel.
Phoebe: Oh no, how?
Monica: He- he pooped in my shoe.
Phoebe: Which one?
Monica: Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Phoebe: No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one
is lucky...
Rachel: C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Joey: Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you
go?
Chandler: Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of
the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Rachel: Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna
kill me!
Monica: Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second
floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Rachel: Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Monica: Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in
my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
(They all leave)
Rachel: Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
[Cut to a hallway in the building, Monica and Phoebe are knocking on a door. Mr.
Heckles emerges.]
Mr. Heckles: Whaddyou want?
Monica: Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Mr. Heckles: I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
Monica: No!
Phoebe: Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Mr. Heckles: I wasn't ready for it.
Monica: A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Mr. Heckles: Saw Regis Philbin once...
Phoebe: Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)
Mr. Heckles: You owe me a waffle.
[Cut to Monica and Rachel's.]
Rachel: (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white
face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay.
Thanks.
Ross: Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Rachel: Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Ross: Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Rachel: Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it
here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Ross: Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder
capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we
were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)
Well-
Rachel: Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Ross: Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine) 
Rachel: Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Ross: Oh, what? What-what?
Rachel: Y'know Marcel?
Ross: ...Yeah?
Rachel: Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
[Cut to outside the window, with Ross reacting with disbelief. The shot pans back until
we see Marcel sitting on the window ledge.]
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Ross: (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment.
Rachel: I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Ross: No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,
uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a
pencil.
Rachel: (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody
looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?
Intercom: Animal Control.
Rachel: See? I've even called Animal Control!
Ross: You called Animal Control?
Rachel: Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Ross: Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to
have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Rachel: O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Ross: That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the
apartment!
(A knock on the door. Rachel swiftly opens it)
Rachel: Hi, thanks for coming.
Luisa: (Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?
Rachel: Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his
arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
Ross: Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Rachel: Turned out it was a hat.
Ross: Cat!
Rachel: Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
(Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in)
Monica: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Luisa: Marcel?
Ross: My uncle Marcel.
Phoebe: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Luisa: Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh,
punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Phoebe: Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to
yourself first?
Phoebe: Yes, but there isn't always time!
Monica: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a
seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Luisa: Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Rachel: Yeah!
Luisa: Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Rachel: Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Monica: The Luisa from home room!
Rachel: Yes!!
Luisa: You have no idea who I am, do you.
Monica: No, none at all.
Rachel: None.
Luisa: Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean,
would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To
Rachel) But you? What a bitch!
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that
monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Luisa: I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)
Phoebe: Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
[Cut to another part of the building. We see Marcel jump in through a window and run
down some stairs, then Chandler and Joey come down from the upper floor without noticing.]
Chandler: Marcel?
Joey: Marcel?
Chandler: Marcel?
Joey: Marcel?
(They come to a door and silently agree to try it. A very sweaty woman emerges)
Woman No. 1: Hi, can I help you?
(Chandler and Joey are dumbstruck for a moment)
Chandler: Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for
something...
Joey: A monkey.
Chandler: Yes have you seen any?
Woman No. 1: No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing
radiators?
Joey: Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Woman No. 1: Of course.
Joey: Oh. Then, no.
(Another sweaty woman comes to the door and speaks to her friend)
Woman No. 2: Did I put too much rum in here?
(Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances)
Woman No. 1: Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She
starts to shut the door)
Chandler: Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about
radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and
cooling... mileu.
Joey: Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Chandler: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're
very hot.
Joey: We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry,
but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers
to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us
out.
(The women quickly shut the door)
Chandler: Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Joey: Marcel?
Chandler: Marcel?!
[Cut to Monica and Phoebe searching the basement.]
Phoebe: Marcel?
Monica: Marcel?
Phoebe: Marcel?
Both: Marcel?
Phoebe: Oh-my-God!
Monica: Whaaat!
Phoebe: Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Monica: What is it?
Phoebe: Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
(Marcel makes a monkeyish noise. He is sitting in the corner)
Monica: Look, Phoebe!
Phoebe: Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
(Luisa appears on the stairs)
Luisa: Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)
Monica: What're you gonna do?
Luisa: Just a small tranquiliser.
(In slow motion we see Phoebe look at Marcel, then at Luisa. She jumps toward Marcel
just as Luisa fires the gun.)
Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after
him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
Phoebe: Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in
the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.
Monica: Oh gosh.
[Cut to Marcel walking along a hallway. He notices a banana on the floor and picks it
up. The hand of an unseen person grabs him and carries him away. Then cut to Ross and
Rachel on the street outside.]
Ross: Marcel?
Rachel: Marcel?
Ross: Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's
gone, he's-he's just gone.
Rachel: Ross, you don't know that.
Ross: Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a
sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot!
Thank you very much.
Rachel: Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the
sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Ross: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel
any more!
Rachel: Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Ross: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort
of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally
oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Rachel: Ross.
Ross: I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Rachel: Ross.
Ross: Oh, forget it, okay?
Rachel: Ross!
Ross: What? What?
(A man carrying a box of bananas walks past them. They stare for a minute and then
hobble after him)
Both: Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
(Scene 4: Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles' door. Ross is carrying the box of
bananas. He bangs on the door)
Phoebe: Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the
other side has no idea.
(Mr. Heckles opens the door)
Ross: Hi, did you order some bananas?
Mr. Heckles: What about it?
Ross: Gimme back my monkey.
Mr. Heckles: I don't have a monkey.
Rachel: Then what's with all the bananas?
Mr. Heckles: Potassium.
(There is a monkey-like noise from within and Ross pushes past Mr. Heckles and enters
his apartment)
Ross: Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
(Marcel jumps into view wearing a pink dress. Everybody gasps)
Ross: Marcel! What've you done to him?
Mr. Heckles: That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Ross: Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)
Mr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)
Ross: C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)
Mr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)
Luisa: (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to
the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.
Ross: Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Mr. Heckles: That's my monkey.
Luisa: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Mr. Heckles: That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that
back whenever.
Ross: Alright, I want my monkey.
Luisa: No!
Rachel: Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Luisa: Sorry, prom queen.
Ross: (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been
fat.
Rachel: Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming
queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I
will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but
please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!
Take it!
Luisa: Nope.
Rachel: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that
you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress
off Marcel.]
Ross: It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel
resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Rachel: Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little
outfit.
Ross: Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Rachel: Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Ross: Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great.
...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh,
something grape?
Rachel: That'd be good.
Ross: Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the
main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be
vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh,
not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,
um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
(Barry bursts in)
Barry: Rachel.
Rachel: Barry?!
Barry: I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still
in love with you.
Ross and Rachel: Oh!
Ross: We have got to start locking that door!
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler are looking through Monica's
high school yearbook]
Monica: This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Phoebe: Nope.
Monica: That's because I'm in front of them.
Chandler: Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Monica: Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Joey: I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties
and dating and sex.
Chandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I
had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Monica: Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Phoebe: Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My
butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
End[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.]
Chandler: I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much
rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
Joey: No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest
snack there is.
Ross: I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Monica: (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see
this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Ross: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Rachel: Oh, that is so sick.
Chandler: I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Phoebe: How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in
disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
Chandler: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one
of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be
ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Monica: So have you called her yet?
Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make
disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm
right, right?
Joey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Monica: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you
people.
Phoebe: Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so
testosteroney!
Chandler: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then
hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
Joey: Her answer machine?
Chandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Phoebe: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up
using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?
Phoebe: Okay, they're just talking...
Ross: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to
shove anything?
Phoebe: No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Ross: What? What? What?!
Phoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
Chandler: (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
All: Oh!... Right!
Chandler: Hey Rach!
Monica: How'd it go?
Rachel: Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all
the butter squirts out...
Phoebe: Not a good day for birds...
Rachel: Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to,
but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Ross: That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,
stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Rachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so
nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Ross: That's, that's nice twice!
Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left
at the altar?
Joey: Duh, where've you been?
Rachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
(Ross 'prompts' Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)
Chandler: Yes!
Rachel: Why?
Chandler: I have my reasons.
Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just
happens to be your ex-best friend?
Rachel: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's
stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
[Scene: Barry's Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.]
Rachel: Wow... Wow!
Barry: Yeah.
Rachel: I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Barry: Nooo, it wasn't.
Rachel: Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.]
Chandler: (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the
machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs
up.) Oh God!
Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past two
hours?!
Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!
Ross: What was with the dishes?
Chandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I
might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past
few hours.
Monica: (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with
the telescope!
Phoebe: Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in
here!
Monica: Great, now he's waving back.
Joey: Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Monica: What kinda stuff?
Joey: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm
cooking naked.
Phoebe: You cook naked?
Joey: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
(A pause as they look at Chandler.)
Chandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
[Scene: Barry's Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.]
Barry: What's the matter?
Rachel: Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Barry: No, it was. It was very very good.
Rachel: Well, what about Mindy?
Barry: Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
Rachel: No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Barry: Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.
Rachel: No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. 
Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Barry: (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.
Rachel: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Barry: We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our
honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
(Pause as Rachel realises...)
Rachel: I had a bra.
(Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby
enters.)
Bobby: Hey, Dr. Farber.
(Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.)
Barry: All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're
starting to see some real progress here.
(Bobby looks on, deadpan.)
Rachel: What?!
Bobby: I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
(Rachel glares at him.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters clutching his phone.]
Chandler: Can I use your phone?
Monica: Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be
used as a phone.
(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)
Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Joey: Maybe she never got your message.
Phoebe: Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of
beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Chandler: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ross: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Chandler: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
(He calls and quickly hangs up.)
Phoebe: How many beeps?
Chandler: She answered.
Monica: Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Chandler: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is
choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
(Rachel enters.)
All: Hey! Hi!
Phoebe: How'd he take it?
Rachel: Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)
Monica: (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in
your hair?
Rachel: Oh, do I?
Monica: Uh huh.
Rachel: (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
Monica: You had sex in his chair?!... I said
that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Ross: You-you had what?
Phoebe: Sex in his chair.
Ross: What, uh... what were you thinking?
Rachel: I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history
there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Rachel: Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right
here, right now," what would you say? 
(Ross flounders.)
Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over.
Ross: It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and
oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Phoebe: Where are you going?
Ross: (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I
have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping
up with it. Okay?
(Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)
Chandler: Hello? Hello?
(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops.  As she talks on the phone, an
elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)
Rachel: (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes,
yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can
come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All
right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens)
Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Chandler: So how's Mindy?
Rachel: Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta
call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured
that's where you'd be!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.  Chandler is sitting and staring at
his phone.  Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler.]
Monica: Brrrrrrr!
(Chandler clutches at his phone before realising.)
Chandler: Hell is filled with people like you.
Joey: (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
(Rachel enters from her room.)
Joey: (ducking) Get down!
Rachel: Get down?
Chandler: ...And boogie!
Rachel: Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Monica: Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Rachel: Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?
I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp
together... she taught me how to kiss..
Joey: (intrigued) Yeah?
Rachel: And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Joey: ..Naughty!
Rachel: Right, I'll see you guys later...
Joey: Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to
kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits
and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...
(Joey exits.)
Chandler: Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Monica: Why don't you just take it with you?
Chandler: Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Monica: Why don't you just call her?
Chandler: I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Monica: Do you?
Chandler: No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.
Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I
accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.
(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna
call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me
back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Monica: Don't you have to pee?
Chandler: 'S'why I'm dancing...
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is serving coffee as Mindy enters.]
Rachel: Mindy.
Mindy: Hey, you.
Rachel: Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Mindy: Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Rachel: Sure we should... So.
Mindy: Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend
in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause
she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty
face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Rachel: Okay.
Mindy: Will you be my maid of honour?
Rachel: Of course!
Mindy: Oh that's so great!
Rachel: Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Mindy: That's all!
Rachel: Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
Mindy: That's not all.
Rachel: Oh sure it is!
Mindy: Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Rachel: Um, what- what would make you think that?
Mindy: Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really
weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Rachel: (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I
was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Mindy: Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Rachel: What? What's what you were afraid of?
Mindy: Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a
little thing on the side.
Rachel: What?
Mindy: I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do
it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Rachel: Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Mindy: What do you mean?
Rachel: (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
Mindy: Oh no.
Rachel: Oh, I am so sorry.
Mindy: No me, I am so sorry...
(They hug and Joey enters.)
Joey: (watches them for a while) Oh my.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Ross are doing a crossword, Monica is cooking,
and Chandler is still staring at his phone.]
Ross: Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Chandler: Ring dammit, ring!
Ross: Thanks.
Joey: (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Chandler: What?!
Joey: I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Chandler: (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Monica: Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just
pointing out the irony.
Joey: Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got
the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Chandler: Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Joey: (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney
Marks, please.
Ross: "Heating device."
Phoebe: Radiator.
Ross: Five letters.
Phoebe: Rdtor.
Joey: (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang)
Sidney's a woman.
Monica: So she's a woman! So what?
Joey: Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking
to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate
it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna
walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel
like—(Listens)—Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The
point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Monica: Joey!!
Joey: (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to
Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Monica: The green dress? Really?
Joey: Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Monica: (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
[Scene: Barry's Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters.]
Rachel: Hey. Got a second?
Barry: Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...
Mindy: Hello, sweetheart.
Barry: Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
Rachel: Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Barry: Both of you?
Mindy: Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should
happen to you.
Barry: I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I
couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Rachel: Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Barry: ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Rachel: Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Barry: (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Rachel: Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a
lineup!
Mindy: (to Rachel) You did it twice?
Rachel: Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Mindy: Okay...
Barry: (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll
start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency
here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Barry: Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look,
please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
(Barry exits)
Rachel: Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating
when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump
right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Mindy: Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Rachel: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in
a smock!
Mindy: Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I
still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Rachel: Oh God. 
Mindy: I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still
be my maid of honor...?
Rachel: And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]
Monica: You okay?
Rachel: Yeah.
Monica: Really?
Rachel: Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have
wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Monica: Aww... (They hug)
(Joey enters and looks on approvingly.)
Joey: Big day.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Joey: All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's
got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Phoebe: You know he's gay?
Ross: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle: (entering) Chandler?
Chandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
All: Hi. Hi.
Chandler: What are you doing here?
Danielle: Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your
number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer.
So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Chandler: ...I'm, I'm okay.
Danielle: Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Chandler: That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Danielle: You got it.
Chandler: Okay.
Danielle: G'bye, everybody.
All: Bye.
Phoebe: Whoo-hoo!
Monica: Yeah, there you go!
Ross: Second date!
Chandler: ...I dunno.
Rachel: You don't know?!
Chandler: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about
her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
(They all groan and hit him..)
EndRachel: What does she mean?
Phoebe: I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare
shoes)
Monica: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Teacher: (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt
containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Rachel: She could be you.
(Music starts)
Teacher: Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)
Monica: Okay, I'm not getting this!
Phoebe: (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!
Monica: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably
uncoordinated?
(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)
Rachel: What? You just click when they click.
Teacher: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)
Phoebe: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Monica: Great. It's gym class all over again.
Phoebe and Rachel: Aww.
Teacher: Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Monica: Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her
hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)
Woman: It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I
am. Who's the new tense girl?
Teacher: She's your partner.
Woman: Hi. I'm Monica.
Monica: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Woman: (Fake Monica) Monana?
Monica: Yeah. It's Dutch.
Fake Monica: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her
something in Dutch)
Monica: Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Teacher: And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is entering.]
Ross: (Mortified) Hi.
Chandler and Joey: Hey.
Joey: Where've you been?
Ross: At the vet.
Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Ross: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached
sexual maturity.
Joey: (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
Ross: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Chandler: So what does this mean?
Ross: I'm gonna have to give him up.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.  They guys are sitting there
like the Three Monkeys.]
Joey: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Chandler: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult
already?
Ross: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you
know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Joey: Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to
some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Joey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Ross: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be
one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be
a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.
Chandler: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a
total party zoo.
(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)
Phoebe: Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Chandler: What?
Joey: Did you call the cops?
Rachel: Nope. We took her to lunch.
Chandler: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a
stealer.
Monica: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you
forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing
spirit.
Ross: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Chandler: ...Take off their hats!
Phoebe: Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]
Rachel: No way. No way did you do this.
Fake Monica: Monana was very brave.
Monica: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.
Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and
have breasts...
Monica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I
get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)
Fake Monica: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Monica: 'Scuse me?
Fake Monica: There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing
Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Monica: Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like
you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Fake Monica: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Monica: What?
Fake Monica: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Fake Monica: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that
changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica: Uh-huh.
Fake Monica: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring.
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?
What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I
walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never
getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Monica: Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse.  Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]
Ross: (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the
others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who
this is harder on, me or him.
Phoebe: I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Rachel: Oh, somebody will.
Joey: (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler: You're kidding.
Joey: Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.
You'd think you would've known that!
Chandler: Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Joey: Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Phoebe: ...Flame Boy.
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]
Ross: Where exactly is your zoo?
Dr. Baldhara: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an
interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Ross: Yes.
Dr. Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Ross: No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Dr. Baldhara: Even if he were... cornered?
Ross: Well I, I don't know. Why?
Dr. Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Ross: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Dr. Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr. Baldhara: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,
you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)
Chandler and Joey: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San
Diego.
Joey: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Chandler: ...He's in.
Ross: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Dr. Baldhara: You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and
good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you
twenty percent of the gains.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the
magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in,
obviously drunk.]
Monica: Yo- hooo!
Rachel: Where the hell've you been?
Monica: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Rachel: Are you drunk?!
Monica: Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Rachel: Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been
up here, I've been worried...
(Monica is drinking from the tap)
Rachel: Monica? Monica!
Monica: Water rules!
Rachel: Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if
you're gonna be showing up for work?
Monica: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not
you!
Monica: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the
pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much
more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
(The phone rings and Rachel answers)
Rachel: Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the
credit card people.
Monica: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Rachel: What?
Monica: They've arrested Monica.
[Scene: New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]
Monica: Hi.
Fake Monica: Hey.
Monica: How are you?
Fake Monica: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you
know I was here?
Monica: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica: That I was not expecting.
Monica: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Fake Monica: Oh. Thanks.
Monica: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you,
I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden
Theater!
Fake Monica: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without
you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big
Apple Circus?
Fake Monica: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other
women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica: Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Fake Monica: There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to
being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica: Not necessarily...
Fake Monica: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish
thing.
Monica: Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Fake Monica: Really? Then why are you like that?
[Scene: Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]
Teacher: You by the door. In or out?
Monica: In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
Teacher: You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Monica: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
[Scene: The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.]
PA: This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego,
boarding at gate 42A.
Phoebe: Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay,
but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Ross: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Phoebe: Oh!
Chandler: Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San
Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Joey: I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Ross: Just, just say what you feel.
Joey: Marcel, I'm hungry.
Ross: That was good.
Rachel: (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,
y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Ross: Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
All: Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise
what he means and go to the other end of the room)
Ross: Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits
beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really
gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to
me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,
Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two
seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
(Marcel is put in a cage and taken away.)
Closing Credits
[Scene: A Theater, there is a casting session going on for a play.]
Actor: (Very melodramatically, and very badly) Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Casting Director No. 1: That's fine, thank you.
Casting Director No. 2: Next. (Joey walks onstage)
Joey: Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Casting Director No. 2: Name?
Joey: Holden McGroin.
End(Scene: Central Perk. Everyone is there.) 
Monica: Tell him.
Rachel: No.
Phoebe: Tell him, tell him.
Monica: Just...please tell him.
Rachel: Shut up!
Chandler: Tell me what?
Monica: Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Chandler: (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why
women won't look at me.
Rachel: All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you
and I, were...
Phoebe: Doing it on this table. (points at the table)
Chandler: Wow!
Joey: Exellent dream score.
Ross: Why, why, why would you dream that?
Chandler: More importantly, was I any good?
Rachel: Well, you were pretty damn good.
Chandler: Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
(Monica pats him on his lap)
Rachel: Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Ross: I love it, when we share.
(Ross goes over to the counter. Chandler follows him.)
Chandler: You're okay there?
Ross: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Chandler: I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was
somebody else's subconscious.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier, Chandler is sitting on the table.]
Chandler: Hello Rachel.
Rachel: Get off.
Phoebe: (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill
press?
Joey: I don't know. What are you wearing?
(Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him)
Ross: Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Phoebe: Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my
massage clients.
Chandler: Pirates again?
Phoebe: No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this
"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Joey: Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Chandler: (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Phoebe: What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Chandler: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is
having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
Phoebe: I could be a secretary.
Chandler: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because
it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Phoebe: I could do that.
(Ross's beeper goes off)
Rachel: What are you playing with?
Ross: Oh, it's my new beeper.
Joey: What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Monica: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still
extinct.'
Ross: No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I
mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Chandler: A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Monica: All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)
Rachel: Off to see young Ethan?
Monica: Thank you.
Joey: How young is young Ethan? Young?
Monica: He's... our age.
Chandler: When we were?
Monica: Okay, he's a senior in college.
Ross: College?
Chandler: Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Monica: No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
All: What?
Monica: Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Phoebe: Well, maybe 25-26.
Monica: I am 26.
Phoebe: There you go.
[Scene: Chandler's office, he and Phoebe are there when the phone starts ringing.]
Chandler: Can you hear that?
Phoebe: (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
Chandler: See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe: Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)
Phoebe: (with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a
meeting right now.
Chandler: I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Phoebe: Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your
number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: Ross says hi.
Chandler: Ah!
Phoebe: This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Chandler: Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Phoebe: Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out
there.
Chandler: Okay.
Phoebe: All right. Bye bye.
Chandler: Bye bye.
(The intercom buzzes)
Chandler: (answering it) Yes?
Phoebe: Whatcha doin'?
Chandler: Ooh. (leans against the desk)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there. Monica is just finishing
cleaning the windows.]
Monica: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change
the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause
I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
Rachel: Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this
guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Monica: What?
Rachel: Could tonight be the Night?
Monica: I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you
know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Rachel: So, did you shave your legs?
Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: A-ha!
[Scene: Central Perk. Joey and Ross are there.]
Joey: Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
(Ross's beeper goes off)
Ross: Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Joey: All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
(Ross dials a number on his cellular phone)
Ross: (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, Andr� is not here.
(to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those
kind of services.
Joey: Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services.
Ross: (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right,
JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd
be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.
(Phoebe and Chandler enter)
Joey: Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Phoebe: Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Chandler: See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder
what he means) Me.
Phoebe: No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Chandler: Why not?
Phoebe: Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Chandler: What?!
Phoebe: I thought you knew that.
Chandler: Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Phoebe: Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Chandler: What are you talking about?
Phoebe: Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got
promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.
Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
(Joey and Ross laughs)
Chandler: I can't belive it.
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Chandler: They do me?
Phoebe: You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any
later?'
(Joey and Ross laughs)
Chandler: I don't sound like that.
Ross: Oh, oh Chandler...
Joey: Oh... Yeah, you do.
Ross: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs)
Joey: (reaches for hi scones) My scones.
Phoebe, Joey, and Ross: 'My scones.'
(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs again)
Chandler: Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
(Joey and Chandler laughs)
Chandler: That is so not... That is so not...
That... Oh, shut up!
(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laugh)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Young Ethan are sitting in the couch.]
Monica: Did not.
Young Ethan: I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that
gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Monica: How was that possible?
Young Ethan: Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held
up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking:
why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go.
Monica: Okay.
(They kiss)
Young Ethan: Okay.
Monica: Unless...
Young Ethan: What?
Monica: Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Young Ethan: Yeah, I'd really like that.
(They kiss)
Young Ethan: Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something
you should know.
Monica: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly
married to a goat?'
Young Ethan: Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Monica: Ethan?
Young Ethan: Yeah?
Monica: Are you a virgin?
Young Ethan: Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I
am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Monica: Really?
Young Ethan: Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
(They kiss)
[Time lapse. They are now in Monica's bedroom, on the bed.]
Young Ethan: Wow!
Monica: You keep saying that.
Young Ethan: You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when
you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
(They kiss)
Monica: Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And
I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Young Ethan: Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Monica: No-no. Nothing wrong about that. 
Young Ethan: Oh.
Monica: Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. 
Young Ethan: Huh!
Monica: But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what
the hell does it matter how old we are.
(They kiss)
Young Ethan: Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another
one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Monica: You're not a senior?
Young Ethan: Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Monica: Ok...ay.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, continued from earlier.]
Monica: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't
alive during the Bicentennial.
Young Ethan: I just had sex.
Monica: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Young Ethan: Well, you never told me how old you were.
Monica: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48
states. What were you thinking?
Young Ethan: I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Monica: Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
Young Ethan: ...in love with you.
Monica: Really?
Young Ethan: (nods) Sorry.
Monica: Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school
night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm
Joan Collins.
Young Ethan: Who? 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone exept Monica is there.]
Ross: (on phone) Okay, Andr� should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,
bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.
Chandler: Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Rachel: No, forget it.
Chandler: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Rachel: All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to
Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too.
Joey: All right. (Moves closer.)
Ross: Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Rachel: No.
Ross: You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Rachel: No, it was just the three of us.
Ross: Huh!
Joey: So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and
me and Chandler?
Rachel: (laughs) You know what?
Joey: What?
Rachel: There were times when it wasn't even me.
(Chandler and Joey laughs, until they look at each other then recoil in horror.)
Phoebe: That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)
(Monica enters, wearing a walkman, so she doesn't hear what the others say)
Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe: Hey, Mon.
Rachel: Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
All: (shouting) Mon!
(Monica takes of her walkman)
Monica: What?
Rachel: Ethan called again.
Monica: Oh.
Ross: Are you not seeing him anymore?
Monica: No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Chandler: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get
out of gym.
(Monica stares at Rachel)
Rachel: I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He
stopped by.
Joey: Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the
strongest Power Ranger is?
(Ross and Chandler laughs)
Ross: Oh, yeah.
Monica: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Joey, Chander, and Ross: Sorry.
Ross: It's morphin time!
Joey: Stegosaurus!
Chandler: Tyrannosaurus!
(They all cross they're arms like the Power Rangers do)
Phoebe: Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then
I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!
Rachel: Where are you going?
Phoebe: Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Chandler: Work people? Nobody told me.
Phoebe: No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Chandler: You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.
You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Phoebe: Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.
Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Chandler: You think I should?
Phoebe: I really do, yeah.
Chandler: Okay.
Phoebe: Okay.
Chandler: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that
invited the boss.
[Scene: Chandler's office, he and Phoebe are taking a break from work.]
Chandler: I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I
doing Ebony and Ivory.
Phoebe: You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring
Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I
wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Chandler: Then, I don't get it.
Phoebe: Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,
the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...
They still say you're a great boss.
Chandler: They do?
Phoebe: Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Chandler: I just wan't to...
Phoebe: No, but you can't.
Chandler: But I just wa...
Phoebe: Uh uh.

having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Joey: What about Andr�?
Ross: Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin
Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
(Ethan enters)
Young Ethan: Hey.
Monica: That was gonna be my opener.
Rachel: (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys
check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Ross: I thought that was just a rumour.
Rachel: True story.
Joey: They're here already?
(Rachel, Ross and Ross go to the bathroom)
Young Ethan: All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only
said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have
a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can
talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I
thought that was great.
Monica: It was.
Young Ethan: Then, what's the problem?
Monica: Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Young Ethan: Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Monica: This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you
were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,
I would really...
Young Ethan: No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)
Monica: ...love you.
(Ross, Rachel and Joey come back from the bathroom. They discover that Monica and Ethan
aren't finished talking to each other yet.)

Chandler: Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my
desk by nine o'clock.
Santos: Sure.
Gerston: No problem.
(They go away, trying very hard not to laugh at Chandler)

Carol: Count faster.
Susan: It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep
focusing on Jordie.
Ross: Who the hell is Jordie?
Susan: Your son.
Ross: No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is
Jamie.
Carol: Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to
Jordie.
Ross: What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We
never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan
fiasco.
Carol: Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.

Susan: You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Ross: Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Susan: Yes.
(Phoebe has heard them arguing and comes down the hall, taking them into a broom
closet.)
Phoebe: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you
guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building
and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just
stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Ross: Yeah, Susan.
Phoebe: Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.

them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Carol: Ok.
Rachel: Ok?
Carol: Ok.
Rachel: (to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it
sounds fascinating.
Dr. Franzblau: It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by
my hotel. (Carol sits up in pain, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau casually lay her back down)
There you go, dear. 
[Scene: Lydia's Room, Joey is helping her deliver.]
Joey: Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,
harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,
hey, ho, ho. Let's— (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was
just—yeah, right. Push! Push! 
[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross has picked up a vacuum and is holding it at the door.]

behind her.]

great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you
don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?
(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. 
(Monica sees a woman pass by with a baby, puts the phone to her chest, and starts to
cry. Chandler takes the phone, makes a noise in it resembling static, and hangs up. Joey
enters.)
Chandler: Where have you been?
Joey: Oh, just had a baby.
Chandler: Mazel tov!
[Scene: The Waiting Room, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau have gone to get coffee.]
Dr. Franzblau: I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's
doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Rachel: (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Dr. Franzblau: No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Rachel: Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Dr. Franzblau: No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you
know, where I do.
Rachel: Oh.
Dr. Franzblau: I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard,
when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
Rachel: I'm a waitress.
Dr. Franzblau: Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the
end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Rachel: (getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.
Dr. Franzblau: I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Rachel: Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)
[Scene: The Hall Outside Lydia's Room, Joey is walking up to Lydia's room with
balloons, but before he enters he sees that the baby's father has arrived. He listens at
the door.]
Lydia: So how did you know I was even here?
Guy: Your mom called me. So is this her?
Lydia: No, this is a loaner.
Guy: I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Lydia: I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey
smiles) So, did you see who won the game?
Guy: Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Lydia: Yeah, they're not so bad.
(Joey closes the door and ties the balloons to the knob. Then he walks away, holding
the hand of an inflated balloon animal he had brought.)
[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross is trying to open the door with a credit card, with no
success.]
Ross: Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all
your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is
being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Susan: The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just
as much as you have.
Ross: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,
ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with
the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Susan: You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Ross: Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Phoebe: This is so great.
Ross: You wanna explain that?
Phoebe: I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my
mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to
make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care
about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not
even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm
sorry, you were fighting.
[Scene: Carol's Room, she is ready to give birth. Everyone is there except for Phoebe,
Ross, and Susan, who are in the broom closet.]
Carol: Where are they?
Monica: I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Rachel: Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Joey: Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Chandler: (to Joey) You are really frightening me.
(Carol suddenly screams in pain and grabs Chandler by the shirt.)
Chandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her
hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
Dr. Franzblau: All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Nurse: All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Carol: But they're not here yet!
Dr. Franzblau: I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Carol: Oh, god.
[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross has used a broom to open the air vent in the ceiling.
Phoebe is wearing a janitor's uniform, ready to go up in the vent.]
Ross: Ok, got the vent open.
Phoebe: (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker
Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Ross: Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two,
three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
(Ross and Susan lift Phoebe up into the vent.)
Susan: What do you see?
Phoebe: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in
fact a dark vent.
(A janitor opens the closet door from the outside.)
Ross: Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
(Ross and Susan run to the delivery room, leaving Phoebe dangling from the vent.)
Janitor: (to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!
[Scene: Carol's Room, Ross and Susan rush in.]
All: Push, push!
Ross: We're here!
Carol: (irked) Where have you been?
Ross: Long story, honey.
Dr. Franzblau: All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I
need—(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have
this?
Nurse: All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and
there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life
partner, out you go!
All: Good luck!
(Everyone heads for the door.)
Chandler: (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life
partner?
Nurse: Out!
Dr. Franzblau: All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Ross: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?
Carol: (straining) Not.... helping!
Dr. Franzblau: You're doing great, you're doing fine. 
Ross: (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.
Susan: What do you see? What do you see?
Ross: We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the
little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right!
Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Susan: Oh, look at that.
Carol: What does he look like?
Ross: Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Carol: Really?
Phoebe: (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!
Ross: Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
(They look up towards the vent and wave at Phoebe.)
[Scene: The Delivery Room, Carol is holding the infant.]
Susan: No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Ross: (thinking) How 'bout Ben?
Susan: I like Ben.
Carol: Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
Ross: We uh, we just cooked it up.
Susan: That's what we were off doing.
(Monica opens the door.)
Monica: Hi.
Ross: Hey.
Monica: Can we come in?
(The whole gang enters.)
Ross: (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Phoebe: Susan, he looks just like you.
Susan: Thanks.
Rachel: Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Chandler: I know, I still am one of these.
Monica: Ross, can I?
(Monica holds Ben.)
Ross: The head, the head. You gotta...
Monica: (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm
your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Closing Credits
[Scene: The Hospital, the camera is placed as though it were Ben's eyes.]
Ross: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be
around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.
(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still
always come back, like this. (returns) 
(Chandler comes into the picture.)
Chandler: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
(Does a baseball sign.)
(The rest of the group come into the picture.)
Monica: He is so amazing.
Rachel: Oh, I know. Look at him.
Joey: Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Phoebe: Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's
opening his eyes. (picture comes back) 
Joey: He doesn't do much, does he?
Ross: No, this is pretty much it.
(long moment of silence)
Rachel: You guys wanna get some coffee?
All: Yeah.
Ross: All right, I'll see you guys later.
(They all leave but Ross, but they all come back a few seconds later. They make faces
at the baby.)
Phoebe: Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
(The screen fades to black.)
End[Scene: Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is showing pictures of his new baby

Phoebe: Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Rachel: Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just want to kiss him all over!
(Ross is practically drooling over Rachel at this point.)
Ross: (quietly) That would be nice.
(Chandler, annoyed with Ross's fawning, makes a 'pfft' noise.)
Rachel: Pardon?
Chandler: Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks
over to where Joey is seated)
(Joey is looking at his check.)
Joey: Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Chandler: Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe
me... 17 jillion dollars.
Joey: I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Chandler: (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
Joey: Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...
research.
Ross: (overhearing) What kind of research?
Joey: Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Ross: Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,
they all look over)
Joey: (sigh)... It's a fertility study.
(Rachel laughs.)
Monica: Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Joey: Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I
just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,
but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Ross: Hey.
Phoebe: Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!

give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for
like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my
itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to
Monica)
Phoebe: Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
Ross: (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it
to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Monica: Yeah.
(Phoebe puts the picture of Ross up to her face.)
Phoebe: Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture
down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Ross: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I
left.
Monica: Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Ross: Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?
Monica: You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Ross: No.
Phoebe: Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Ross: At the coffeehouse, right.
Phoebe: So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.
Ross: OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Phoebe: Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
(Ross goes outisde on the balcony.)
Ross: Hi.
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: (sigh)....I have to go to China.
Joey: The country?
Ross: No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know
who Carl is?
Chandler: Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Ross: Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Joey: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Chandler: Forget about her.
Joey: He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Chandler: Course there, they just call it food.
Ross: Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give her
this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)
Joey: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Ross: I know.
Joey: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...
I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)
Chandler: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
[Time lapse. Melanie, Joey's girlfriend, is there with Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe,
and Rachel. Ross is gone.]
Melanie: Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket
business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Joey: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Chandler: (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
Monica: (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Rachel: Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)
(Everyone follows Rachel to the living room. Monica pulls Joey aside.)
Monica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Joey: Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're
gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
(Monica rolls her eyes.)
Joey: Then you do. Heh, heh.
Monica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Joey: What do you mean?
Monica: Y'know, just be there for her.
(Long pause... Joey looks confused.)
Joey: Not following you.
Monica: Think about it.
(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift
is a fruit basket.)
Rachel: OK, I'm guessing this is from...
(Melanie smiles.)
Rachel: Well, thank you, Melanie.
Chandler: (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
Rachel: (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...
it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)
(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)
Rachel: This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels
like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!
Phoebe: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Joey: (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.
Melanie: There is a little child inside this man!
Chandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
(Rachel picks up the next gift.)
Rachel: Who's this from?
Chandler: Oh, that's Ross's. 
Rachel: Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe: Remembered what?
Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was
a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Chandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel
Scrabble game)
Phoebe: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica: I can't believe he did this.
Chandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross's crush on
Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)
Rachel: What did you just say?
Chandler: (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Rachel: No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Chandler: (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel: Oh.... my God.
Chandler: (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Joey: (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Rachel: I mean, this is unbelievable.
Phoebe: I know. This is really, really huge.
Chandler: No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe: Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever
again.
Chandler: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Monica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Rachel: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something
about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else
did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Joey: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't
mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Rachel: Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)
Chandler: (quickly) H-He's in China!
Joey: The country.
Monica: No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for
another forty-five more minutes.
Chandler: What about the time difference?
Monica: From here to the airport?
Chandler: Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
Monica: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Rachel: I-I-I don't know.
Chandler: Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
Joey: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the
kind of thing that can wait.
Monica: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Rachel: I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Phoebe: Here, look, alright, does this help?
(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)
Rachel: Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.
I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...
OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)
Chandler: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
[Scene: Airport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a 'How To Speak Chinese'
tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is
getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there.]
Ross: (something in Chinese)
Flight Attendant: Alright!
Ross: Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
(Rachel runs into the airport, trying to catch Ross, moving people out of the way.)
Rachel: Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
(Rachel gets up to the jetway.)
Flight Attendant: Hi!
Rachel: Hi.
Flight Attendant: May I see your boarding pass?
Rachel: Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Flight Attendant: Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless
you have a boarding pass.
Rachel: No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the
blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Flight Attendant: No no no! Federal regulations!
Rachel: OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a
message for me? Please? This is very important.
Flight Attendant: Alright. What's the message?
Rachel: Uh... I don't know.
[Cut to the Jetway, the flight attendant enters, walks past Ross, and approaches an
older man with his wife who is also wearing a blue jacket.]
Flight Attendant: Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Man: (confused) What?
Flight Attendant: It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she
will see you when you get back.
Man: (to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking
about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
[Scene: Joey's Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together.]
Melanie: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a
minute!
Joey: Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Melanie: Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing
his chest)
Joey: (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give
you another turn.
Melanie: (surprised) M-Me again?
Joey: Sure! Why not?
Melanie: Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
(Joey starts to kiss her.)
Melanie: Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Joey: How do you mean?
Melanie: I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys
who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I
ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding
the wrapping paper from one of Rachel's gifts.]
Monica: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,
it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw
it out?
Rachel: I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and
I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross.
Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Monica and Phoebe: Sure.
Rachel: I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm
thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Monica: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the
best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's
like starting on the fifteenth date!
Phoebe: Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth
date.
Monica: Another good point.
Phoebe: No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're
already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Rachel: (confused) Huh?
Phoebe: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Monica: Why isn't it working out?
Rachel: I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Monica: Is he not cute enough for you?
Rachel: No!
Monica: Does he not make enough money?
Rachel: No, I'm just....
Phoebe: Maybe there's someone else.
Rachel: Wha...
Monica: Is there? Is there someone else?
Rachel: No! There is.. there is noone else!
Monica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his
bedroom door.]
Chandler: Hey, big...
Joey: Shhhh!
Chandler: (quietly) ...spender.
Joey: She's still asleep.
Chandler: So how'd it go?
Joey: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Chandler: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know
me.
Joey: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me
great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was
like a ticker tape parade!
Chandler: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade
route.
Joey: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all
of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was
able to appreciate it on another level.
Chandler: I didn't know you had another level.
Joey: I know! Neither did I!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her
bedroom.]
Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Rachel: Yeah.
Monica: Oh, from who?
Rachel: From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Monica: Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple
hours? At gate 27-B?
Rachel: Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and
I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Monica: Oh, why?
Rachel: Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be
going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't
wanna...
Monica: (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Rachel: Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Monica: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be
good. I promise.
(Door buzzer goes off. Rachel answers it.)
Rachel: Who is it?
Intercom: It's me, Carl.
Rachel: C'mon up.
Monica: Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind
of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with
baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand.]
Joey: Seven hundred bucks!
Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Joey: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I
learned something.
Chandler: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Joey: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk
around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl.]
Carl: I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid
electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against
environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
(Rachel looks bored. At this point, Ross—a figment of Rachel's imagination—
shows up on the balcony and starts talking to her.)
Ross: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Rachel: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Ross: Fine, just stop thinking about me.
(She tries, and Ross disappears momentarily. He reappears, standing closer to her.)
Ross: Can't do it, can you?
Rachel: So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Ross: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Rachel: Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Carl: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Ross: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Rachel: Ross, it's too hard.
Ross: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares
about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth
grade. 
Rachel: Ross, you're like my best friend.
Ross: I know.
Rachel: If we broke up, and I lost you...
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Rachel: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ross: (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both
know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you
attracted to me?
Rachel: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross: Well, start looking. 
(They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.)
Rachel: Wow.
Carl: Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this
hammerhead in traffic!
Rachel: Right! You're right!
Carl: Heh... y'know?
Rachel: You know what?
Carl: What?
Rachel: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so
sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her
drink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. 
(Rachel leaves.)
Carl: But...
[Scene: Airport. Madonna's Take A Bow plays in the background as Rachel waits at
the gate with flowers.]
Rachel: (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,
sorry. Hi.
[Cut to the jetway, the old man who the flight attendant delivered Rachel's message to
gets off the plane, his wife still upset with him.]
Man: For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off next.)
Ross: Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
(Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)
Julie: Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Ross: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Julie: Really?
Ross: Yeah. 
Julie: You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Ross: No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Ross and Julie: Can't wait.
Ross: Come on, they're gonna love you.
[Cut to a close-up of Rachel, eagerly awaiting Ross's arrival... not
knowing he is getting off the plane with another woman.]
End[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is recapping last season, and as she talks we see a
montague of scenes from Ross and Rachel.]
Phoebe: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with
Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of
got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about
her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in
love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet
him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane
with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough
about us. So, how've you been?
Opening Credits
[Scene, The Airport, continued from last season, Rachel is waiting for
Ross to come of the plane, when she sees he's coming off with another woman.]
Rachel: Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me.
Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.) 
Ross: (seeing her) Rach!
Rachel: Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with
the flowers.)
Ross: It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Rachel: What?
Ross: You're bleeding. 
Rachel: I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr.
Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)
Ross: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Rachel: These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly,
thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.
Julie: (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.
Rachel: Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok.
Baggage claim? Ok.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is waiting for Rachel to return from the airport
with Ross.]
Chandler:  No way!
Monica: I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with
Ross! 
Phoebe: Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all
right, what's bigger than huge?
Joey: Um, this?
Phoebe: Yes.
Monica: Guys, you got your hair cut.
Chandler: Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Phoebe: 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look
good. I love that voice.
Rachel: (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm
around her. Cramp, cramp.
Chandler: Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
(She hits Chandler.)
Rachel: (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter)
You, you slowpokes!
Ross: That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my
sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?
Joey: What up?!
Ross: Everyone, this is Julie.
Rachel: (out of breath) Julie.
All: Ohh. (Happily) Hi!
Julie: Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first
impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Ross: And bus.
Julie: Oh my god.
Ross:  The screaming guy?
Julie:  And the spitting?
Ross: You gotta hear this story.
Julie: We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
Ross: 200 at least.
Julie:  ...and this guy...
Rachel: And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away
the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I
can think about.
Monica: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Julie: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Ross: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig. 
Rachel: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just
kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Monica: (to Julie) It's an expression.
Ross: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the
baby.
Julie: And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Ross: Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Chandler: Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like
to be surprised.
(Ross and Julie exit)
Rachel: Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler enter.]
Ross: Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Rachel: Yeah, sure.
Ross: Thank you.
Chandler: Hey, Rach, can I get...
Rachel: Did you talk to him?
Chandler: Not yet.
Rachel: Then, no.
(He goes to sit down next to Ross.)
Chandler: So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left
you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Ross: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that
kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Chandler: God?
Ross: It was you, pal.
Chandler: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Ross: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But
then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never
would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Chandler: Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Rachel: (To Ross) Here's your lemonade.
Ross: I didn't order lemonade.
Rachel: Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge
you for that. 
Ross: But...
Rachel: Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So
uh, what did you find out?
Chandler: He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm
sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by
himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
Rachel: How is that the silver lining?
Chandler: You have to really wanna see it.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and the gang is watching Sumo wrestling on TV.]
Ross: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
[Cut to Phoebe and Monica in the kitchen.]
Monica: Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Phoebe: Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if
they've changed it?
Monica: No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Phoebe: All right, so what were you thinking?
Monica: Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I
thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Phoebe: Ohh! No.
Monica: Why not?
Phoebe: Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control
freak.
Monica: No you're not.
Phoebe: I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
(The phone rings.)
Joey: (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's
Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)
Ross: (on phone) Hello? Hi.
Chandler: (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Joey: Needs some clothes altered?
Chandler: No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Joey: Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He
did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All
right, when was 1990?
Chandler: Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Ross: (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits
down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up
either. 
Rachel: She didn't hang up either!
Ross: Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Rachel: (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking
to me.
Ross: Rachel! I'll just call her back. 
Rachel: Okay!
Ross: (calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)
Rachel: (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen
to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's
Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Monica: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Rachel: I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with
it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)
Chandler: Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.]
Joey: (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.
Monica: (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.
Phoebe: I'm still on "no."
Rachel: (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you
could close your eyes for just a sec?
Joey: No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.
Phoebe: What's goin' on?
Rachel: Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Chandler: What stupid thing did you do?
Paulo: (entering from Rachel's room) Bon giorno tutti!
Phoebe: Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Rachel: Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your
way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)
Monica: Rachel, how did this happen?
Rachel: I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Phoebe: Where?
Rachel: At his apartment. Is this juice?
Joey: Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Rachel: Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Monica: Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Chandler: People do stupid things when they're upset.
Monica: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone
looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.
(Ross and Julie enter.)
All: Hi!
Ross: Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching.
Paulo: (entering) Hey, hey Ross.
Ross: Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Paulo: I do Raquel.
Ross: (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back.
Rachel: Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Ross: No, not a problem.
Rachel: Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Phoebe: (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Chandler: Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got
pants that need to be altered.
Joey: Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
He'll know what it means.
Chandler: Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Monica: (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair
was so much shorter and cuter.
Phoebe: All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be
all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Monica: I promise.
Phoebe: All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get
cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
[Scene: Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is finishing with her haircut and Monica is whincing.]
Phoebe: All right, that's it, I quit.
Monica: What? I didn't say anything.
Phoebe: Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who
trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,
doesn't trust a person.
Monica: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we
had discussed.
Phoebe: Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Monica: How who wears it?
Phoebe: Demi Moore.
Monica: Demi Moore is not a he.
Phoebe: Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Monica: That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Phoebe: Oh.  Oh!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Monica: She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent
Proposal, Ghost!
Phoebe: Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
Monica: I know!
[Scene: Frank's tailor shop, Chandler is getting his pants measured.]
Frankie: How long do you want the cuffs?
Chandler: At least as long as I have the pants.
(Pause as Frankie resumes his work.)
Frankie: I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
(He slowly measures it up his leg, and Chandler makes a rather surprised face.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is recovering from her haircut, Phoebe is playing
her doctor and is coming in from the bedroom.]
Rachel: How is she?
Phoebe: It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Ross: How's the hair?
Phoebe: I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on
one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Joey: Can we see her?
Phoebe: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't
you come on in. 
Ross:  Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that
meant.)
(They go into the bedroom leaving Joey and Rachel alone.)
Joey: How're you doing?
Rachel: I'm okay.
Joey: Ooh, that bad, huh? 
Rachel: What?
Joey: Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's
one of my gifts.
Rachel: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock
bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Joey: You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Rachel: Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Joey: What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been
in love with you for like 10 years.
Rachel: I don't know, I don't know.
Joey: Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been
with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the
way Ross felt about you.
Chandler: (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)
Your tailor is a very bad man!
Joey: Frankie? What're you talking about?
Ross: (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the
shoulder which causes him to jump.)
Chandler: Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Ross: What?
Joey: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Chandler: Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand
up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Ross: What?
Chandler: Cupping.
Joey: That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,
then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler
and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure
pants?
Ross: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Joey: What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, later that day.  Monica is now out and about.]
Monica: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Ross: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)
Monica: Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Chandler: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between
the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Phoebe: (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.
Ross: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Rachel: (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?
Ross: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Rachel: Well, can I talk to you for a sec? 
Ross: Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
Joey: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Chandler: That's ok.
[Out on the balcony]
Ross: What's goin' on?
Rachel: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a
stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,
second of all (Ross is laughing), what?
Ross: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those
things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next
day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Rachel: No. No-no-no-no.
Ross: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I
actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a
guy like that. 
Rachel: Really?
Ross: You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets
how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who
wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone
who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing
that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?
Rachel: No, I think that was the whole all.
Ross: Okay.  Okay. (They hug.) Okay.
[Cut back inside, Joey is on the phone.]
Joey: I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Julie is wanting to get her hair cut from Phoebe.]
Julie: I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie
McDowell's new haircut?
Phoebe: Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.
Julie: Really?
Phoebe: You wanna do it right now?
Julie: Great! (Julie leaves)
Phoebe: (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's
the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Rachel: No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Rachel: You're welcome.

End[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are showing off Ben to the gang.]
Monica: (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were
unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I
couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)
Phoebe: Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,
oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Susan: Oh, is he hungry already?
Carol: I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)
Chandler: You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)
something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)
Joey: (joins him) I gotta get one, too.
Ross: (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?
Chandler: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Ross: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in
the world.
Joey: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Ross: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better
get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask
questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
(They go back into the living room)
Ross: Carol?
Chandler: Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about
breast-feeding?
Carol: Sure.
Joey: Uh, does it hurt?
Carol: It did at first, but not anymore.
Joey: Chandler?
Chandler: So, uh, how often can you do it?
Carol: As much as he needs.
Joey: Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get
bigger?
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, the gang is all there.]
Julie: Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Rachel: Yeah, I forget which ones.
Julie: Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? 
All: No thanks.
Julie: (To Rachel) Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you
go. (Ties it back up for her)
Rachel: (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.
Julie: Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's
quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and
take advantage of it?
Phoebe: I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Monica: Ok, um, I'll go with you. 
Julie: Great.
Ross: (enters) Hi, honey.
Chandler: Hey, sweetums.
Ross: Hello to the rest.
All:  Hi!
Joey: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about
Rachel?
Monica: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Chandler: Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's
like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Monica: But I'm...
Phoebe: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Ross: (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Monica: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Ross: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Monica: You're welcome.
Phoebe: Woof, woof. 
[Scene: A Department Store, Joey is selling men's cologne.]
Joey: (A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men?
(Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.) Hey
Annabelle.
Annabelle: Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Joey: Who?
Annabelle: Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
(The Hombre man enters.)
Hombre Man: (to a customer) Hombre? (The guy says yes, and gets his
sample.)
Joey: What's he doin' in my section?
Annabelle: I guess he doesn't know.
Joey: Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man)
Hey, how ya doin'?
Hombre Man: Mornin'. 
Joey: Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from
Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Hombre Man: Your territory, huh?
Joey: Yeah. Bijan for men?
Guy: No thanks.
Hombre Man: Hombre?
Guy: Yeah. All right. (They guy gets his sample and leaves.)
Hombre Man: (To Joey) You were saying?
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Monica enters.]
Monica: Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Phoebe: What?
Monica: We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Phoebe: Oh, all right. What did I have?
Monica: You had a salad.
Phoebe: Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Rachel: (entering) Hey, guys, what's up.
Phoebe: I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Rachel: Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Phoebe: Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Rachel: You went shopping for fur?
Phoebe: Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought
some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.
Rachel: You bought boobs?
Phoebe: (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought
bras. 
[Scene: The Department Store, Joey is trying to sell some cologne.]
Joey: (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan
for... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh,
listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Annabelle: Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Hombre Man: (entering) Ready, Annabelle?
Annabelle: You bet. (to Joey) Maybe some other time?
Joey: (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy
spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and
Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?! 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol is dropping Ben off for Ross to watch.]
Carol: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not
before his naps or he won't sleep.
Ross: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,
we play. It's like we're father and son.
Susan: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look so
surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Rachel: Oh, this is so cute.
Susan: Oh, I got that for him.
Ross: My mommies love me. That's clever.
Monica: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju—(Sees Rachel is watching)—Hi, Jew! (Walks
into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure,
that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Rachel: Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Monica: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes
it. Reaffirms his faith.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey are eating, and Phoebe is
preparing Ben's milk.]
Phoebe: Ben, dinner!
Ross: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's
breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Phoebe: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her
wrist and tastes it.)
Chandler: What did you just do?
Phoebe: I licked my arm, what?
Ross: It's breast milk.
Phoebe: So?
Rachel: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Joey: What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)
Chandler: What did you just do?
Ross: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Phoebe: You won't even taste it?
Ross: No!
Phoebe: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Ross: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.  Rachel is entering the living room from
her bedroom as Monica enters.]
Monica: Hey, where is everybody?
Rachel: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Monica: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks
for your jacket.
Rachel: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the
pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and
notices she also grabbed a receipt.)
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53
dollars?
Monica: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Rachel: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Monica: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Rachel: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Monica: Judy.
Rachel: Who?
Monica: Julie.
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Jody!
Rachel: You were with Julie?
Monica: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she
was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we
were...shopping.
Rachel: Oh. Oh my God. 
Monica: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Rachel: Yeah, right.  Sure!
Monica: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,
all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Rachel: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)
Monica: That is not true!
Rachel: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Monica: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Rachel: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
(Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with
you right now. (Exits.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ben is playing in his crib while Chandler and Ross are
leaning against the rim and are completely asleep.]
Monica: (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as
simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.
(There's a knock on the door which is answered by Phoebe.)
Carol and Susan: Hey! (This wakes Chandler and Ross up)
Carol: How did we do?
Phoebe: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Ross: I did not freak out. 
Carol: Why'd you freak out?
Ross: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Carol: My breast milk is gross?
Susan: This should be fun.
Ross: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.
Chandler: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Carol: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
(Holding out a bottle.)
Ross: (jumping away) That would be no.
Phoebe: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Joey: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
Susan: Cantaloupe juice.
Joey: Exactly.
Ross: (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Susan: Uh huh.
Ross: Oh, you've tasted it.
Susan: You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Ross: (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and
Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it
off.) 
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is wiping down the peninsula counter as Joey
enters dressed like a cowboy.]
Chandler: Howdy.
Joey: (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a
juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Chandler: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Joey: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people
on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes
through two bottles a day.
Chandler: (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you
care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Joey: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs
the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Chandler: (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.
You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And
then where're you gonna run?
Joey: Yeah I guess you're right.
Chandler: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made
of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west
of the lingerie.
Joey: I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)
Chandler: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice
hooker.
[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel is cleaning up and Monica is pleading with her.]
Monica: I don't know what else to say.
Rachel: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Monica: I feel terrible, I really do.
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Monica: Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend
some time together. Is that so terrible?
Rachel: Yes.
Monica: It's that terrible?
Rachel: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy
who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually
(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.
Monica: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,
just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,
(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Rachel: I love you too. (They hug.)
Phoebe: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with
me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and
sits down.)
Monica: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to
hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a
guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Rachel: (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Monica: (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)
Phoebe: Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)
[Scene: The Department Store, Joey and the Hombre man are facing off in Joey's
section.]
Joey: Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'.
Hombre Man: I heard ya.
Store Guy: All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
Hombre Man: Ready.
Joey: Yeah, I'm ready.
(An old West style showdown starts with Joey and the Hombre Man staring each other down
as the store guy slowly lets in the first customer while Joey and the Hombre Man get ready
to draw.  In slow motion they spot the customer, eye each other, draw, and as the
customer walks into the middle Joey's bottle misfires but the Hombre Man spays it into the
customer's eyes.)
Customer: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Store Guy: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
Hombre Man: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Annabelle: (seeing the end result) My god, what happened?
Joey: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Annabelle: Sure.
(They walk off into the sunset, at least a picture of one.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Julie and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]
Julie: So.
Rachel: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you
know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,
though, right?
Julie: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.
Rachel: Really? Me?
Julie: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really
wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the
feeling that maybe you don't.
Rachel: Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Julie: Oy.
Rachel: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it
was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but
um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,
Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Julie: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or
something?
Rachel: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Julie: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Rachel: All right, Julie.
Julie: Bye. (Gets up.)
Rachel: Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, another showdown is occuring, only this time
its between Ross, a plate of cookies, and the breast milk.  They've been eyeing each
other for a while now, and Chandler and Joey are getting bored.  He checks his Ross
and in frustration, shoves his watch in front of Ross's eyes as if saying, "Hurry it
up already!"  Finally, Ross scratches his head, does that again, itches his
nose, scratches his head, grabs the bottle, takes a big swig, and piles several cookies
into his mouth.]
Ross: (with a mouthful) That's not bad. 
EndCHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: So how was Joan?
CHANDLER: I broke up with her. 
CHANDLER: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
RACHEL: Come on, they were not that huge.
CHANDLER: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
MONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial
insignificant things?
JOEY: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to
the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she
had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
CHANDLER: You or me?
ROSS: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
JOEY: You guys are messin' with me, right?
ALL: Yeah.
JOEY: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
PHOEBE: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
CHANDLER: Maureen Rosilla.
ROSS: Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
(knock)
MONICA: Hello, Mr. Heckles.
MR. HECKLES: You're doing it again.
MONICA: We're not doing anything.
MR. HECKLES: You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
RACHEL: You don't have birds.
MR. HECKLES: I could have birds.
MONICA: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
MR. HECKLES: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
RACHEL: All right, bye-bye.
CHANDLER: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
ROSS: We'll give you Janice.
PHOEBE: I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
RACHEL: "Oh, my, god."
JOEY: "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
MONICA: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
RACHEL: We won. We won!
MONICA: Mr. Heckles.
RACHEL: How did this happen?
MR. TREEGER: He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
MONICA: That's terrible.
MR. TREEGER: I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'.
You never know.
MR. TREEGER: You never know.
PHOEBE: Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the
light, Mr. Heckles!
CHANDLER: Ok, Phoebe.
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You
know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not
true.
JOEY: Such as?
PHOEBE: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
PHOEBE: Nah. Not really.
ROSS: You don't believe in evolution?
PHOEBE: I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a
nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
ROSS: Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over
millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I just don't buy it.
ROSS: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific
fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
PHOEBE: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
ROSS: You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
PHOEBE: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know,
it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down
as I am being pushed.
(knock)
CHANDLER: Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
MR. TREEGER: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy
Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
MONICA: What can we do for you?
MR. BOYLE: All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to
leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above
mine".
MONICA: Well, what about his family?
MR. BOYLE: He didn't have any.
RACHEL: Ok, so let's talk money.
MR. BOYLE: All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one,
you be noisy girl number two.
MONICA: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it
amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look
at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
RACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?
CHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
JOEY: Check this out. Can I have this?
ROSS: How can you not believe in evolution?
PHOEBE: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
ROSS: Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we
have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of
different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
PHOEBE: Really? You can actually see it?
ROSS: You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
PHOEBE: See, I didn't know that.
ROSS: Well, there you go.
PHOEBE: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
CHANDLER: Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
JOEY: Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a
date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
CHANDLER: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the
dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
RACHEL: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
MONICA: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
RACHEL: What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything,
which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
MONICA: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
RACHEL: Well, what about my stuff?
MONICA: You don't have any stuff.
RACHEL: You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
MONICA: No.
RACHEL: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents
a room.
MONICA: Mmmmm.
RACHEL: Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for
my new lamp.
ROSS: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without
evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
PHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
ROSS: Please tell me you're joking.
PHOEBE: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
ROSS: No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
PHOEBE: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No,
what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
ROSS: Is there blood coming out of my ears?
JOEY: Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
CHANDLER: Wow, he looks so normal.
PHOEBE: He's even kind of cute.
JOEY: "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in
school.
CHANDLER: Funniest? Heckles? 
JOEY: That's what it says.
CHANDLER: Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you
listen to that?
PHOEBE: I'd call that excessive.
CHANDLER: Whoa! 
JOEY: What?
CHANDLER: Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the
scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were
cool.
JOEY: So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
CHANDLER: I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and
Heckles...Would you knock it off?
JOEY: Have you been here all night?
CHANDLER: Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what
he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when
she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he
did.
JOEY: Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
CHANDLER: Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years
behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
JOEY: All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll
buy you breakfast, let's go.
CHANDLER: What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped
her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
JOEY: Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
CHANDLER: How do you know that? How?
JOEY: I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
CHANDLER: You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end
up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for
holidays?
JOEY: Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're
at her folks' place?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I understand.
JOEY: You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
CHANDLER: You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
JOEY: Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
CHANDLER: (on phone) Hi, it's me.
JANICE: Oh, my, god.
PHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?
CHANDLER: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
ROSS: You remember Janice, right?
CHANDLER: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice
is my last chance to have somebody.
JANICE: Helloo!!
CHANDLER: Oh, my, god!
JOEY: Geez, look how fat she got.
JANICE: Hey, it's everybody.
CHANDLER: Janice, you're--
JANICE: Yes, I am.
CHANDLER: Is it--?
JANICE: Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady
now.
CHANDLER: Congratulations.
JANICE: Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
CHANDLER: You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
JANICE: And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
MONICA: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
RACHEL: What?
MONICA: Hide the Lamp.
RACHEL: Monica, let it go.
MONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
RACHEL: Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
PHOEBE: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
ROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A
briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
PHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying
that it's one of the possibilities.
ROSS: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
PHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time
when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like
what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it
open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so
unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you
could be wrong about this?
ROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
PHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.
ROSS: What?
PHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree
with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work
tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to
face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
RACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.
MONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my
jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
RACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden,
it's just magically broken?
MONICA: Phoebe, tell her!
PHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to
believe you.
RACHEL: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
CHANDLER: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
RACHEL: Ok, you win.
MONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
CHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
PHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?
CHANDLER: If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook,
like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a
Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will
walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll
shout!
MONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
CHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with
me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
RACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone
out with.
MONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.
RACHEL: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
MONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
CHANDLER: In a bad way?
MONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even
have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate
with someone.
RACHEL: Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
PHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
MONICA: You made it!
PHOEBE: You're there!
RACHEL: You are ready to make a commitment!
CHANDLER: Whoa! Don't know about that.
RACHEL: What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
MONICA: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look
good in our apartment.
RACHEL: Thank you.
MONICA: That's fine.
CHANDLER: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.
This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been
holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But,
I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
JOEY: Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
CHANDLER: I'll take that.
JOEY: You want his yearbook?
CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody
should have it.
MONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and
now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr.
Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to
hell.
RACHEL: It's really not that big!
CHANDLER: Takin' that with you, huh?
JOEY: Oh, yeah.
ROSS: You comin'?
CHANDLER: Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
ALISON: Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the
classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
CHANDLER: Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get
hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good
dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)

END[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is on the phone.]

RACHEL: Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking
alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street,
this is a safe building, there's nothing [a pigeon flies in the window and lands on the
table] OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. [hangs up] OK,
that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. [grabs a pot
and lid] OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. [puts pot over
the pigeon] Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, aaaaahh. [knock at the door] It's open you guys.

[a stranger enters with flowers]

STRANGER: Hi.

RACHEL: Hi, hi can I help you?

STRANGER: Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?

RACHEL: Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.

STRANGER: Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. [leaves flowers on bar]

RACHEL: What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away]

STRANGER: Hey, how, how did you do that?

OPENING TITLES 
[Scene: Monica and Rachels apartment. The whole gang is there.]

JOEY: This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?

PHOEBE: Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's
gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.

MONICA: I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived
together, we told each other everything.

PHOEBE: I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and
you would not approve.

MONICA: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who,
hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

ROSS: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.

PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.

MONICA: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat
a cheeseburger.

ALL: Huuh.

MONICA: Well, didn't you?

PHOEBE: I might have.

MONICA: I can't believe you didn't tell me.

PHOEBE: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.

MONICA: What have I not told you?

PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the
telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.

RACHEL: What!

MONICA: Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are
dead meat.

CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.

MONICA: Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't
know, having a third nipple.

PHOEBE: You have a third nipple?

CHANDLER: You bitch.

ROSS: Whip it out, whip it out.

CHANDLER: C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.

RACHEL: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?

JOEY: I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.

ROSS: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

JOEY: I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let
me see it again.

ALL: Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.

CHANDLER: Joey was in a porno movie.

ALL: Huuh.

CHANDLER: If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.

ROSS: You were in a porno?

JOEY: Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the
last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix
the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.

MONICA: That is wild.

ROSS: [to Chandler] So what's it shaped like?

PHOEBE: Yeah, is there a hair on it?

JOEY: What happens if you flick it?

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, and Julie are sitting on the couch.]

ROSS: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?

CHANDLER: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the
magical land of Narnia.

JULIE: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.
You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.

CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?

ROSS: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?

RACHEL: [to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.

MONICA: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with
her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.

RACHEL: Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I
just have to get over it.

[Phoebe enters all dressed up]

ALL: Woah.

JOEY: Foxy lady.

JULIE: Where you goin'?

PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the
Capades.

JOEY: The Ice Capades?

CHANDLER: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls.
. . funny.

MONICA: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting
yourself up all over again.

PHOEBE: OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling
behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look
nice for your gay husband.

ROSS: [holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front
of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?

CHANDLER: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . 

[Scene: Central Perk close to closing. Ross and Julie are still there. Rachel is cleaning
tables.]

ROSS: OK sweetie, I'll see you later.

JULIE: See you later Rach.

RACHEL: Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves]

[Rachel is still cleaning, Ross is laying on the couch. Ross kicks Rachel in the butt.]

RACHEL: Hey.

ROSS: Hey.

[Ross kicks her again]

RACHEL: Hey, c'mon, cut it out.

ROSS: Hey?

RACHEL: What?

ROSS: Can I ask you somethin'?

RACHEL: Sure.

ROSS: Naa.

RACHEL: What? C'mon, talk to me.

ROSS: OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the
sex?

RACHEL: Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and
Julie not having sex?

ROSS: Technically, huh, no.

RACHEL: Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like,
kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?

ROSS: No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we,
we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .

RACHEL: No, no no no, don't need to know the details.

ROSS: It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life
and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and
it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.

RACHEL: No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact
you know what I think?

ROSS: What?

RACHEL: I think it's sexy.

ROSS: Sexy?

RACHEL: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does
not want to have sex.

ROSS: No kidding?

RACHEL: Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?

ROSS: What?

RACHEL: I'd wait.

ROSS: You'd wait?

RACHEL: Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.

ROSS: Really?

RACHEL: Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs,
she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just
means it's working.

ROSS: Women really want this?

RACHEL: More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Duncan's dressing room.]

PHOEBE: Hi.

DUNCAN: Phoebe!

PHOEBE: Ta-da.

DUNCAN: Hey.

PHOEBE: Hi.

DUNCAN: Ahh, look at you, you look great.

PHOEBE: Do I? Thank you, so do you.

DUNCAN: Thanks.

PHOEBE: Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I
remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.

DUNCAN: You always said I'd make it.

PHOEBE: Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.

DUNCAN: I missed you. [they hug] I'm gonna get changed.

PHOEBE: OK.

DUNCAN: Um, now. Phoebs.

PHOEBE: Oh, right, OK. Ole.

DUNCAN: What?

PHOEBE: Um, the matador. [Duncan leaves] Ole, ha ha ha.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross and Julie are setting the table.]

ROSS: Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. [hands her a bowl and kisses her]

[Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel enter. Ross and Julie don't notice.]

CHANDLER: Uh, Julie.

JULIE: Yeah?

CHANDLER: Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're
alright.

ROSS: Hi everyone.

ALL: Hi.

ROSS: [pulls Rachel aside] I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk
before.

RACHEL: Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?

ROSS: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

RACHEL: What did, what did he say?

ROSS: Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about
what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight
so. . .

[Scene: Ross's apartment. After dinner. Chandler enters.]

CHANDLER: What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.

ROSS: Pop it in.

JOEY: I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled
people. [Chandler puts the tape in]

RACHEL: Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.

ROSS: What's wrong with people having sex?

RACHEL: Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and
females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.

MONICA: Hell, I wanna see Joey.

[video starts with the cheesy porn disco music]

JULIE: So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.

CHANDLER: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.

MONICA: All I say is, she better get the job.

ROSS: Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.

JOEY: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to
the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And
then I say, wait, here's my line, [Joey from TV] you know that's bad fo r the paper
tray.

CHANDLER: Nice work my friend.

JOEY: Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin'
me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .

[Scene: Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is fixing her hair and
Duncan enters.]

PHOEBE: So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.

DUNCAN: Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.

PHOEBE: Ohh. . .K. How come?

DUNCAN: Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.

PHOEBE: What?

DUNCAN: Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.

PHOEBE: Huuh.

DUNCAN: Yeah, I know, I.

PHOEBE: I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so
smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.

DUNCAN: I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you
can't live a lie anymore.

PHOEBE: So how long have you known?

DUNCAN: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed
to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just
tryin' to fit in.

PHOEBE: And um, and there's actually a, a woman?

DUNCAN: Her name's Debra.

PHOEBE: Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?

DUNCAN: Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college,
when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But
I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. 

PHOEBE: Sure.

DUNCAN: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.

PHOEBE: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six
years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'

DUNCAN: I'm, I'm still me.

PHOEBE: Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Everyone is sitting around. Monica enters from bathroom.]

MONICA: You know, it still smells like monkey in there.

JULIE: That saves us a conversation.

CHANDLER: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.

JOEY: Me too, we should get goin'.

RACHEL: No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty.
Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.

MONICA: Rachel, that's all we do.

RACHEL: Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?

JULIE: What about Julie?

RACHEL: Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really
know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna
hear everything.

JULIE: Well, that could take a while.

RACHEL: So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?

CHANDLER: I got the time to get to know Julie.

JOEY: I got time.

MONICA: Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's
fine.

RACHEL: OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?

JULIE: Well, in a nutshell. . .

RACHEL: Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.

[Scene: Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is signing the divorce
papers.]

PHOEBE: So, um, have you told your parents?

DUNCAN: No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .

PHOEBE: [handing him the papers] Here you go. You know what, I just have one more
question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think
that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink
either answer would make me feel better.

DUNCAN: I love you Phoebe. [they hug and kiss]

PHOEBE: So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Julie is telling her live story.]

JULIE: And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs.
Cobb.

RAHCEL: Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?

JULIE: No Cobb, as in cobb salad.

RACHEL: Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?

CHANDLER: I'm goin' home.

RACHEL: What?

[Outside in the hallway, Chandler, Joey, and Monica exit]

JOEY: Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?

ROSS: Goodnight.

RACHEL: So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .

ROSS: Oh, no no, I am.

RACHEL: Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?

ROSS: Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.

RACHEL: Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna,
are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?

ROSS: I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.

RAHCEL: OK, gook luck.

ROSS: Wha, uhh, what?

RACHEL: Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first
time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.

ROSS: OK, now I'm nervous.

RACHEL: Maybe you should put it off.

ROSS: No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so
unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really
happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.

RACHEL: I know, yeah, sorry.

ROSS: What, it's not your fault.

RACHEL: Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the
right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.

ROSS: Really?

RACHEL: Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to,
I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know
really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and
look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to
happen.

ROSS: [being drawn in by her talk] Uh-huh.

RACHEL: And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that
I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and
uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.

ROSS: Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. [goes back in apartment]

RACHEL: Ohh, God.

CLOSING CREDITS 

[Scene: The next morning on the street. Ross is dancing along, Singing in the Rain
is playing. Two old ladies are sitting on a bench.]

ROSS: Good morning.

OLD WOMAN: Well, somebody got some last night.

ROSS: Twice.
END[Scene: At Chandler and Joey's. Ross and Chandler are there. Ross is watching
wrestling.]
ROSS: Man, I sure miss Julie.
CHANDLER: Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got
there. (phone rings)
ROSS: You ever figure out what that thing's for?
CHANDLER: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm
always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never
gets pinned. 
(MACHINE--JOEY'S VOICE): Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
JADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this
number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's
been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve
to make this call, so you know what I did?
CHANDLER: What?
JADE: I got a little drunk...and naked.
CHANDLER: Bob here.
CHANDLER: (on phone) What've you been up to?
JADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in
case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
CHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.
ROSS: I know.
CHANDLER: I'm back.
JADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?
CHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central
Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
JADE: Great, I'll see you then.
CHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you
tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open
arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
ROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.
CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
(At Monica and Rachel's)
ROSS: (on phone) Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New
Mexico.
ALL: Hi, Julie!
RACHEL: (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.
CHANDLER: Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
PHOEBE: Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like
20?
CHANDLER: Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
JOEY: Do we need a cake?
CHANDLER: Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
RACHEL: Yeah, whoosh!
CHANDLER: But it's Ross.
PHOEBE: It's Ross.
JOEY: All right.
CHANDLER: I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
ROSS: Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey,
you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
CHANDLER: You know, I think I might just.
RACHEL: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
JOEY: Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just
stay home and eat dust bunnies.
PHOEBE: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
RACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't
get that we don't make as much money as they do?
JOEY: Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go
there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
PHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you
know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday
thing, it's for Ross.
JOEY: For Ross.
RACHEL: For Ross, Ross, Ross.
MONICA: (enters) Oh my god. 
RACHEL: Hey.
JOEY: Hi.
RACHEL: What?
MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All
of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head
lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
JOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
MONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very
much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go
out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
JOEY: Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for
my kidney? (at Central Perk)
ROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
CHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
ROSS: That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she
was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
CHANDLER: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
ROSS: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
CHANDLER: All right.
ROSS: Go.
CHANDLER: Hi. 
JADE: Hi.
CHANDLER: Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
JADE: Yes?
CHANDLER: Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
JADE: How did you--?
CHANDLER: I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird
and sensitive. Tissue?
JADE: Thanks.
CHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
(At Somplace Nice)
ROSS: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
MONICA: Who is also in charge of purchasing.
ROSS: Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
MONICA: Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
ROSS: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my
little sister--
MONICA: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
JOEY: Cool.
PHOEBE: Let's see!
ROSS: That's fine, I'll just wait!
MONICA: Oh, sorry.
JOEY: Sorry, sorry.
ROSS: Monica! 
(glasses clinking)
WAITER: Are we ready to order? 
RACHEL: Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
WAITER: Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my
seat.
PHOEBE: Wow, look at these prices.
RACHEL: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
JOEY: What are these, like famous chickens?
CHANDLER: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late.
How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
ROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey,
Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
CHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't
tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
ROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
WAITER: Do I dare ask?
MONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. 
ROSS: That sounds great. Same for me.
WAITER: And for the gentleman?
JOEY: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the
nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
WAITER: You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
RACHEL: Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.
WAITER: (whispers) And what will that be on the side of?
RACHEL: Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
WAITER: And for you?
PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
CHANDLER: I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
WAITER: Anything else?
CHANDLER: Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish,
aren't you?
ROSS: (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
RACHEL: Um, everyone?
ROSS: Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. 
JOEY: Thank you.
ROSS: Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay. 
MONICA: Oh, thank you!
ROSS: So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
PHOEBE: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
CHANDLER: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush
for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with
his like teeny pizza! It's just...
ROSS: Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
PHOEBE: Not for you.
MONICA: All right, what's goin' on?
RACHEL: Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think
it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
PHOEBE: Fine. All right, fine.
JOEY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: You can tell us. 
ROSS: Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
JOEY: Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we
don't have as much money as you.
MONICA: Ok.
ROSS: I hear ya. 
CHANDLER: We can talk about that.
PHOEBE: Well, then...Let's.
ROSS: I, I just never think of money as an issue.
RACHEL: That's 'cause you have it.
ROSS: That's a good point.
CHANDLER: So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
JOEY: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole
Ross's birthday hoopla.
ROSS: Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of
negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
RACHEL: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
MONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll
just do the gift.
ROSS: G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
CHANDLER: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
ROSS: Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
PHOEBE: No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
ROSS: No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be
together.
MONICA: All of us.
CHANDLER: Together.
ROSS: Not at the concert.
RACHEL: Ok.
JOEY: Yeah.
RACHEL: Thank you.
JOEY: Thanks.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
CHANDLER: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
(at Monica and Rachel's)
CHANDLER: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
MONICA: I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
PHOEBE: Oh, it's like a skit.
MONICA: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. 
ROSS: Whoo!
PHOEBE: Cool.
MONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks
as sort of a thank-you.
ROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
CHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
ROSS: Come on.
CHANDLER: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
MONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
PHOEBE: So...Thank you.
ROSS: Could you be less enthused?
JOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
MONICA: Like?
JOEY: Charity.
MONICA: Charity?
ROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
RACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
PHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.
ROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
CHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how
you feel.
JOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
RACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
PHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place
right now.
RACHEL: Me neither.
JOEY: Me too.
MONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.
PHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and
stuff.
CHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?
MONICA: Well, I guess now we can't go.
RACHEL: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything
together?
MONICA: You know what? You're right.
PHOEBE: Fine.
ROSS: Fine.
JOEY: Fine.
CHANDLER: Fine.
RACHEL: Fine.
MONICA: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
ROSS: Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Yeah?
ROSS: Geez! Are you ready?
CHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
ROSS: Whoa! You had sex today?
CHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She
was biting her lip to stop from screaming. 
ROSS: Wow.
CHANDLER: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
(phone rings)
ROSS: Still doing the screening thing?
CHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
JADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt
when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
CHANDLER: Bob here.
JADE: Oh, hi.
CHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh?
JADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. 
CHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?
JADE: Eh.
CHANDLER: Eh?
JADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from
screaming your name.
CHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.
JADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.
ROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?
CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar
with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
JADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
(at the concert)
MONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
CHANDLER: So, let's go.
ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
MONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
(at Monica and Rachel's)
JOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.
PHOEBE: Ok. One.
JOEY: Nooo.
MONICA: That was amazing!
ROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.
CHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.
ROSS: What guys? Oh, yeah.
STEVE: Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
MONICA: Do I know you?
STEVE: You used to be my babysitter.
MONICA: Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
STEVE: Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
MONICA: You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
STEVE: Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
MONICA: Uh, wait, backstage?
STEVE: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
ROSS: Ross.
CHANDLER: Chandler.
STEVE: How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of
the ones who fooled around with my dad?
(at Central Perk)
ROSS: Hey, you guys.
RACHEL: Happy birthday.
ROSS: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
RACHEL: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
MONICA: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?
RACHEL: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
MONICA: Uh, good.
ROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
CHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.
JOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
PHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a
hickey?
MONICA: No, I just, I fell down.
RACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
MONICA: You know, a party, or--
RACHEL: What party?
ROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and,
and the band.
JOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
CHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
RACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?
MONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.
RACHEL: Oh!
PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you
know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
ROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
RACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
(Monica's pager goes off)
MONICA: It's work.
CHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But
we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it. 
JOEY: And we don't work hard?
MONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
CHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
JOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.
CHANDLER: Yes.
RACHEL: Oh!
CHANDLER: No.
MONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift
from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget
the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
PHOEBE: Oh.
(Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)
WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
JOEY: Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?
MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
JADE: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been
3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night
together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
(Joey lunges for phone and misses.)

END[Scene: At Monica and Rachel's.]

MONICA: Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't
cry. Why is he still crying?

ROSS: Let me hold him for a sec. There. (Ben stops crying) Huh? There we are.

MONICA: Maye it's me.

ROSS: Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.

CHANDLER: You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.

ROSS: There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)

MONICA: There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)

CHANDLER: Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries.
When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)

JOEY: Cool.

MONICA: He hates me. My nephew hates me.

ROSS: Come on, don't do this.

MONICA: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?

CHANDLER: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before
you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.
Joey, she does not look fat.

(Chandler has a basketball which he is moving closer to, then away from, Monica)

JOEY: Goo, goo, goo, waaah!

MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)

JOEY: Are you ok, Ross?

ROSS: I don't know. What's in this pie? 

MONICA: Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- 

ROSS: Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.

MONICA: No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. 

ROSS: And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.

MONICA: No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.

ROSS: Ugh.

MONICA: Oh my god.

ROSS: Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.

MONICA: Is your tongue swelling up?

ROSS: Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.

MONICA: All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.

JOEY: Is he gonna be ok?

MONICA: Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.

ROSS: You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone
for Thcrabble?

MONICA: Jacket now.

ROSS: What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.

CHANDLER: We'll watch him.

ROSS: I don't think tho.

JOEY: What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on,
we wanna do it, don't we?

CHANDLER: I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.

ROSS: Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and
there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.

JOEY: Hat, milk, got it.

ROSS: ??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!

JOEY: Consider it done.

CHANDLER: You understood that?

JOEY: Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

CHANDLER: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?

(Central Perk)

PHOEBE: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote
it this morning in the shower.

RACHEL: Ok.

PHOEBE: (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My
skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.

TERRY: Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?

RACHEL: What's up?

TERRY: F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday
afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.

RACHEL: But what about Phoebe?

TERRY: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want
to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.

RACHEL: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.

TERRY: Uh--

RACHEL: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?

PHOEBE: (singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse,
repeat, as needed.

(Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben)

CHANDLER: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the
baby's anvil?

JOEY: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women
love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o'
babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got
one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.

CHANDLER: No, I got him.

JOEY: No, seriously.

CHANDLER: Oh, seriously you want him?

CAROLINE: Hello.

BOYS: Hello.

CAROLINE: And who is this little cutie pie?

CHANDLER: Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?

JOEY: You wanna smell him?

CAROLINE: I assume we're talking about the baby now.

JOEY: Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.

CAROLINE: I think my uterus just skipped a beat.

JOEY: (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?

CAROLINE: I think it's great you guys are doing this.

CHANDLER: Well, we are great guys.

CAROLINE: You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three
years. What agency did you two go through?

(Central Perk)

PHOEBE: But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in
chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.

RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry.

PHOEBE: And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a
throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.

RACHEL: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!"
That's where that came from.

PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. 

RACHEL: Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look,
look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you
won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.

TERRY: I, I don't know. 

RACHEL: Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.

TERRY: You don't clean the cappuccino machine?

RACHEL: Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.

TERRY: Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.

RACHEL: Done.

PHOEBE: Really?

RACHEL: Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?

PHOEBE: Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?

RACHEL: What?

PHOEBE: Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.

RACHEL: Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a
professional.

PHOEBE: Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.

RACHEL: Well, but Pheebs.

PHOEBE: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You
know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay
to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need
your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....

ROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and
thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. 

DOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.

MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia
about needles.

ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?

MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. 

DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.

ROSS: Tho?

(Monica shakes her head.)

ROSS: Ohhh.

MONICA: That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just
gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?

ROSS: Ok.

MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross,
don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my
hand!

CHANDLER: That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to
the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!

JOEY: Hey, hey, look at that talent.

CHANDLER: (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.

GIRL 1 ON BUS: Hey, you. He's just adorable.

CHANDLER: Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.

GIRL 2 ON BUS: So what are you guys out doing today?

JOEY: Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son
of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.

CHANDLER: You done?

JOEY: Yeah.

GIRL 1: Oh, there's our stop.

JOEY: Get outta here. This is our stop too.

GIRL 2: You guys live around here too?

JOEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.

CHANDLER: You know it?

JOEY: Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a
drink?

GIRL 1: So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?

CHANDLER: Oh, sure, they love us over there.

GIRL 2: Where's your baby?

CHANDLER AND JOEY: (running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben! 

CHANDLER: Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.

BOTH: Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! 

MONICA: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.

DOCTOR: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your
ring.

ROSS: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we
can celebrate later. Celebrate. 

PHOEBE: (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the
professional guitar player?

STEPHANIE: Yeah. I'm Stephanie.

PHOEBE: Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um,
so um, how many chords do you know?

STEPHANIE: All of them. 

PHOEBE: Oh yeah, so you know D?

STEPHANIE: Yeah.

PHOEBE: Ok, do you know A minor?

STEPHANIE: Yeah.

PHOEBE: Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?

STEPHANIE: Yeah.

PHOEBE: Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?

STEPHANIE: No.

PHOEBE: Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)

CHANDLER: (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello.
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a
baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.

JOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a
handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to
you again.

RACHEL: Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--

PHOEBE: (singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central
Perk!

RACHEL: Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.

STEPHANIE: Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever
loved. (singing) Zachary.

PHOEBE: (singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!

CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths
bus. Is he here? Is he here?

TRANSIT AUTHORITY GUY: He's here. (Chandler and Joey hug each other in relief) I'm
assuming one of you is the father.

CHANDLER: That's me.

JOEY: I'm him.

CHANDLER: Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)

BOTH (but to different babies): Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!

CHANDLER: Please tell me you know which one is our baby.

JOEY: Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was
definitely wearing ducks.

CHANDLER: Ok.

JOEY: Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little
mole by his mouth.

CHANDLER: Yeah?

JOEY: Yeah.

CHANDLER: Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.

JOEY: Ahh!

CHANDLER: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?

JOEY: Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

CHANDLER: Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?

JOEY: You got a better idea? 

CHANDLER: All right, call it in the air.

JOEY: Heads.

CHANDLER: Heads it is.

JOEY: Yes! Whew!

CHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.

JOEY: Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.

CHANDLER: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?

(on the sidewalk outside Central Perk)

RACHEL: Hey.

PHOEBE: Oh, hi.

RACHEL: Here. I thought you might be cold.

PHOEBE: Thank you.

RACHEL: Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.

PHOEBE: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just
to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.

RACHEL: Do you?

PHOEBE: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I
don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then,
"Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really
bad for Smelly Cat.

RACHEL: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean,
if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!

PHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's
like, it's just all about the money.

RACHEL: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for
"Smelly Cat".

PHOEBE: Really? From who?

RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.

KID: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.

PHOEBE: Yeah. Here you go.

KID: Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!

(chez Monica and Rachel)

ROSS: I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke
your hand.

MONICA: That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.

ROSS: Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?

MONICA: Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?

ROSS: Oh.

MONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?

ROSS: Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped
over and hit your head on the curb? 

MONICA: No. But I remember people telling me about it.

ROSS: I hope Ben has a little sister.

MONICA: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.

ROSS: I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu
Ken?

MONICA: That was you?

ROSS: They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.

MONICA: Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my
little boy. Hey, he's not crying.

CHANDLER: (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.

(Ben starts crying)

JOEY: Yes! There's still pie.

ROSS: I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have
fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?

JOEY: Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.

ROSS: Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of
Human Services on his butt?

CHANDLER: You, you are gonna love this. 

ROSS: Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.

CHANDLER: Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!

STEPHANIE: (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?

PHOEBE: No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".

STEPHANIE: Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...

PHOEBE: Better. Yeah.

STEPHANIE: Yeah?

PHOEBE: Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.

STEPHANIE: Yeah. 

PHOEBE: You wanna try it again?

STEPHANIE: Yeah. From the top?

PHOEBE: Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just
follow me?

STEPHANIE: Ok.

PHOEBE: Mmmm hmmm.

TOGETHER: Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's
not your fault.

PHOEBE: That's too much. Sorry.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone is sitting at the couches,
Chandler enters.]

CHAN: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . .
repellant. . . about me?

RACH: So, how was the party?

CHAN: Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so
what is it, am I hideously unattractive?

PHOE: No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same
thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.

CHAN: Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?

PHOE: No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.

MNCA: Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can
remake you.

CHAN: Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.

MNCA: Please.

ALL: C'mon. Let her. Yeah.

CHAN: Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours,
I'm goin' home.

PHOE: Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here.
[hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back] Oh, can't make.... hands...
meet....

OPENING TITLES 

[Scene: Hallway between the apartments. Chandler comes out wearing spandex, jogging in
place. Monica is there.]

CHAN: OK, let's do it. [Monica looks at him funny] What?

MNCA: Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.

CHAN: And we're changing. [jogs back in his apartment]

[Cut to the city street. Monica and Chandler are jogging. Chandler is lagging behind so he
hops in a cab and takes off, leaving Monica behind]

[Scene: Back in Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is doing situps.]

MNCA: C'mon give me five more. Five more.

CHAN: [weakly] No.

MNCA: Five more and I'll flash you.

CHAN: One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch. Rachel is working.]

CHAN: [slowly lifts coffee cup to his mouth] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [slowly sets the
cup back down] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [Joey intercepts the cup and puts it down for him].
She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work.
She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.

[Phoebe enters.]

RACH: Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?

PHOE: Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.

JOEY: The guy still won't put out, huh?

PHOE: Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.

ALL: Sorry Phoebs.

PHOE: Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really
interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?

JOEY: Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I
mean.

PHOE: No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.

JOEY: Maybe he's. . . gay.

PHOE: Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the
other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I
just like... definitely felt something.

RACH: Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?

PHOE: No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.

[Monica enters.]

MNCA: [to Chandler] Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.

CHAN: Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.

PHOE: [seeing Ross kissing Julie outside the window] Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.

RACH: What? [looks, feigns indifference] C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date
tonight.

JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?

RACH: Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.

JOEY: But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?

RACH: Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've
decided to opt for sanity.

CHAN: So you really OK about all this?

RACH: Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he
wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.

[Ross and Julie enter.]

ROSS: Hi guys.

ALL: Hey.

ROSS: Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy,
OK?

MNCA: Only if you say his full name.

ROSS: [reluctantly] Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.

MNCA: Alright.

JOEY: [to Ross] You're getting a cat?

ROSS: Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.

RACH: Together?

ROSS: Uh huh.

RACH: Both of you?

ROSS: Yep.

RACH: Together.

JULIE: Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.

RACH: Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to
enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.

ROSS: Hopefully.

RACH: Well. [looks at watch] Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um,
OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a,
uh, really good cat. [she leaves carrying her tray then comes back in] OK, we're not
supposed to take these when we leave.

[Scene: A nice restraunt. Rachel is on her date with Michael (MICH).]

MICH: I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my
divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.

RACH: [distracted] How long do cats live?

MICH: [confused] I'm sorry?

RACH: Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or
something?

MICH: Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

RACH: That's just great. [she picks up her champagne and starts drinking]

MICH: Um, cheers.

RACH: Oh, right, clink. [downs her glass]

MICH: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?

RACH: Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably
not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

MICH: Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.

RACH: I mean he just started going out with her.

MICH: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?

RACH: Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's
talk about you. 

MICH: Alright.

RACH: OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch.]

PHOE: So, I figured it out.

JOEY: What?

PHOE: Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.

JOEY: Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I
said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

PHOE: Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.

JOEY: Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask
him.

PHOE: You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. [they hug]

[Outside the window, Monica and Chandler jog up. Monica playfully pushes him. They start
puching and slapping harder and harder until Monica pushes him down. Chandler stands up,
with a serious expression, and chases her away.]

[Scene: Back in the restraunt. Rachel pours the last of the champange bottle in her
glass.]

RACH: [obviously drunk] I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get
one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day
or something? [belligerently] What're they called, what're they called, what're they
called?

MICH: Fruitflies?

RACH: Yes! Thank you.

[The waiter comes to the table.]

WAITER: So, would you like any dessert?

MICH: No! No dessert, just a check, please.

RACH: Oh, you're not having fun, are you?

MICH: No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the
movie Diner in my head.

RACH: Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can
think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why
can't I do that?

MICH: Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't
see it now because you haven't had any closure.

RACH: Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why
didn't I think of that? How do I get that?

MICH: Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so
that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."

RACH: Closure, that's what it is. Closure. [she looks around the restaurant, spotting a
guy with a cellular phone] Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo [she almost falls out
of her chair]

GUY: Hang on.

RACH: Hello, excuse me.

GUY: What.

RACH: Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.

GUY: I'm talkin'!

RACH: I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it
myself. [man is still reluctant] OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.

GUY: Alright, fine. [on the phone] I'll call you back. [hands the phone to her]

RACH: Thank you. OK. [dials] [to Michael] Machine. Just waiting for the beep.

MICH: Good.

RACHEL: [on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's
fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name
Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I
am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and tosses phone in
the ice bucket]


COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is answering the door in his robe.]

CHAN: No, no, no, no, no, no [opens door to Monica] No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm
not running on a Sunday.

MNCA: Why not?

CHAN: Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.

MNCA: OK, if you say stop, then we stop.

ROSS: Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat
toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?

RACH: I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't
remember.

ROSS: OK. Oh, oh, oh. [runs over and picks up the cat toy]

RACH: Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?

ROSS: No, I stayed at Julie's last night.

RACH: Huh.

ROSS: Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?

RACH: Oh yeah, go ahead. [Rachel walks in her room. Ross picks up the phone and dials his
machine to check his messages.]

ROSS: Rach, I got a message from you. [pauses] Who's Michael?

[Rachel comes out of her room, suddenly she remembers leaving the message.]
RACH: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me
the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back,
finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]

ROSS: You're over me?

RACH: Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back]

ROSS: Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?

RACH: Ohh, ohh.

ROSS: When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . .

JULIE: [over intercom] Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.

ROSS: [perky] I'll be right down.

RACH: Wait, so, you're going?

ROSS: Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh,
y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.

RACH: OK, OK.

ROSS: Cat. [leaves]

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is watching a rabbi play an electric guitar on
TV. Phoebe enters.]

PHOE: Hey Joey.

JOEY: Hey Phoebs.

PHOE: How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?

JOEY: I can't find the remote. [Phoebe turns off the TV] Thank you.

PHOE: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.

JOEY: And?

PHOE: And we did.

JOEY: All right Phoebs, way to go.

PHOE: Yay me.

JOEY: So, so how did it happen?

PHOE: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.

JOEY: And what did he say?

PHOE: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a
woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna
call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la.
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.

JOEY: Wow.

PHOE: Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about
two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can
call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.

JOEY: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he
never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.

PHOE: Um-hum.

JOEY: This man is my God.

[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is closing up and Ross comes in. Get your Kleenex.]

RACH: Hi.

ROSS: I didn't get a cat.

RACH: Oh, that's um, interesting.

ROSS: No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's
actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.

RACH: Alright, I got it Ross.

ROSS: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.

RACH: [hurt] What?

ROSS: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.

RACH: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to
see you with Julie?

ROSS: Then you should have said something before I met her.

RACH: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.

ROSS: There was never a good time.

RACH: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.

ROSS: Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try,
Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or,
or Italian guys.

RACH: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?

ROSS: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with
somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

RACH: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it
was you felt for me?

ROSS: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.

RACH: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.

ROSS: Fine.

RACH: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.

ROSS: Good.

RACH: Good. [Ross leaves] 
[Rachel gets up and opens the door, yelling after him.]
RACH: And ya know what, now I've got closure.

[Rachel slams the door and locks it. She sits down, visibly upset. She puts her head in
her hands and begins to cry. Ross comes back and is standing outside the window. When
Rachel regroups and gets back up to finish closing, she sees him. She smiles. She goes to
open the door and can't get the lock undone.]

ROSS: Try the bottom one.

[She opens the door and they kiss.]

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler answers the door to find Monica.]

CLOSING CREDITS 

CHAN: Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.

MNCA: No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone
we're groovin'.

CHAN: OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound.
OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.

MNCA: Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?

CHAN: Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.

MNCA: Well, thanks.

CHAN: I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.

MNCA: Well, you know.

CHAN: You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be
disappointed.

MNCA: [sad] Uh-huh.

CHAN: And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

MNCA: Well no, but um.

CHAN: I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.

MNCA: Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .

CHAN: So, you feel like goin' for a run?

MNCA: Alright.

CHAN: Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right
here.

MNCA: OK. Just for a little while.

CHAN: OK. [Puts an afghan over her and dances into his room]
END[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel are there, discussing
the night before.]
RACH: Ross kissed me.
MNCA: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
RACH: It was unbelievable!
MNCA: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
PHOE: Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the
phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
RACH: Oh, it ended very well.
PHOE: Oh.
MNCA: [getting the wine] Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
PHOE: Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush
against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of
thing?
RACH: Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we
just sort of sunk into it.
PHOE: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
RACH: No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then,
they were in my hair.
PHOE/MNCA: Ohhhh.
[Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross, Chandler, and Joey are there eating pizza.]
ROSS: And, uh, and then I kissed her.
JOEY: Tongue?
ROSS: Yeah.
JOEY: Cool.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk. Joey, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are there; Chandler is
showing everyone his new computer.]
CHAN: All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive.
Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
PHOE: Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
CHAN: [doggedly] Games and stuff.
MNCA: [reading the paper] There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
JOEY: [reading over her shoulder] Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook
naked?
MNCA: There's an ad for a naked chef?
JOEY: No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance
naked. And then... [rubs his fingers together]
[Ross enters, distraught.]
ROSS: Hi.
PHOE: Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
ROSS: That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just
painful
MNCA: Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
ROSS: Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night
table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am,
I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me,
and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
JOEY: You got all that from saline solution?
MNCA: We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
ROSS: Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now,
I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... [Rachel
enters, carrying a tray]... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
RACH: [to Ross] Hey, you.
ROSS: How are you?
RACH: Good. How are you?
ROSS: Good.
[Julie enters.]
JULIE: Hi, honey.
ROSS: Hi, Julie. [nervous] Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
JULIE: Good.
ROSS: [uncomfortable] Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna
play something, Phoebe?
PHOE: Oh, well, actually.
ROSS: [impatient] Play it.
PHOE: Ok, all right.
JOEY: Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
JULIE: What?
ROSS: [to Joey] Ssshh.
PHOE: Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between
three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last
Night". 
[Ross and Rachel look at each other and then at Phoebe, realizing the song is about
their situation.]
PHOE: [singing] There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil.
Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must
decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves
truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide,
even though I made him up, he must decide!
[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's (RTST) office. Monica is there about a job.]
RTST: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
MNCA: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
RTST: Mockolate.
MNCA: I'm sorry?
RTST: Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
MNCA: Ohh.
[He pulls out a piece of Mockolate.]
RTST: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than
chocolate.
MNCA: All right. Mmm-mmm.
[She tastes it, and obviously hates it.]
RTST: Yeah?
MNCA: [disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your
chocolate doesn't do that.
RTST: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now,
hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already
dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
MNCA: [still chewing] Mmm-mmm.
RTST: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the
Mockolate holiday.
MNCA: Wow.
RTST: Aren't you going to swallow that?
MNCA: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
RTST: Yeah, isn't that great?
MNCA: [with false enthusiasm] Mmm.
RTST: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some
Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
MNCA: Abso...[swallows hard]...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love
Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
RTST: Really?
MNCA: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till
Christmas.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are there. Monica is
suggesting Mockolate recipes to Phoebe.]
MNCA: How about Mockolate mousse?
PHOE: It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
MNCA: Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
PHOE: What makes it pilgrim?
MNCA: We'll put buckles on it.
[Rachel enters.]
RACH: Hey.
PHOE: Hey.
MNCA: Hey.
RACH: Did uh, Ross call?
MNCA: No, I'm sorry.
RACH: Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with
her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get
married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
PHOE: No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is up in arms about the Rachel/Julie
situation.]
ROSS: I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a
complete nightmare.
CHAN: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both
gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too
tight.
JOEY: Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]
CHAN: Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
JOEY: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
[Ross gives him an insulted look.]
CHAN: Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel
and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I
can use different colors for each column.
ROSS: Can't we just use a pen?
CHAN: No, Amish boy.
JOEY: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
ROSS: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled
sometimes.
JOEY: You could say that.
ROSS: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen
her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause
we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
CHAN: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What
else?
ROSS: I don't know.
JOEY: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
CHAN: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
ROSS: [long pause] She's not Rachel.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica has made food for Phoebe and Rachel to
taste.]
MNCA: Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate
cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
[Rachel takes a bite.]
RACH: Oh my god.
MNCA: Oh my god good?
RACH: Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
[Rachel runs to the sink to spit it out.]
PHOE: Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is on the phone with a computer
hotline.]
CHAN: I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100
times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background?
Are you watching Star Trek?
[Ross enters with a melancholy look.]
JOEY: [to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
ROSS: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway,
I did the right thing.
CHAN: [in phone] So, Spock actually hugs his father?
[Rachel enters.]
RACH: Hey, do you guys have...[sees Ross, pauses]...hi.
ROSS: Hi.
RACH: [sees his coat on] Where you goin'?
ROSS: I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
RACH: [dejected] Oh.
ROSS: No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
RACH: Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
[Joey is looking at Rachel, smiling, and gesturing his head towards Ross.]
ROSS: Well, uh.
JOEY: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
RACH: Really?
ROSS: Really. It's always been you, Rach.
[Ross and Rachel hug.]
RACH: Oh, god.
JOEY/CHAN: Ohhh.
RACH: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
ROSS: I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What
do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
RACH: Let me get my coat.
ROSS: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
[Ross leaves.]
RACH: Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I
can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's
that?
CHAN: [nervous] What? Nothing.
[Chandler closes up the laptop computer screen.]
RACH: What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
CHAN: No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey,
rattled] Hey, it's printing!
[Chandler rips off the sheet of paper from the printer.]
RACH: Well what is it? Let me see.
[Ross walks back in, Rachel's coat in hand.]
ROSS: Hey, someone order a coat?
RACH: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
ROSS: He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the,
the short story you were writing?
CHAN: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
RACH: And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
CHAN, JOEY, ROSS: No!
RACH: Come on.
JOEY: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
[Ross and Chandler stare angrily at Joey, who thinks he has come up with a good idea.]
CHAN: [through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it
was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the
kingdom was his forever. The end."
ROSS: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
RACH: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on
that piece of paper and I want to see it.
ROSS: No, you don't.
RACH: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about
this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the
room, reading it to herself.]
RACH: What is this? Ross, what is this?
CHAN: Good luck.
[Chandler and Joey leave quickly.]
ROSS: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
RACH: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
ROSS: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the
idiot.
RACH: Just a waitress?
ROSS: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
RACH: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
[Rachel leaves, and Ross follows her into the hall.]
ROSS: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
RACH: She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid
paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
[She goes into her apartment and slams the door.]
ROSS: No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not,
Ra--Rachel?
[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]
CHAN: My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she
never would have made me read her my diary.
MNCA: You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an
emergency.
PHOE: I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
JOEY: Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
PHOE: What?
MNCA: What?
CHAN: Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
MNCA: This was your idea?
PHOE: What were you thinking?
CHAN: [squirming] All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they
happen for a reason.
MNCA: Yeah. You!
CHAN: All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't
you?
PHOE: Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting on the couch, eating candy. It
is raining out. Ross climbs up the fire escape and is knocking on the window.]
ROSS: Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
RACH: [coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That
doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
ROSS: I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
RACH: Not interested.
[Rachel closes the drapes over the window, goes into her bedroom and closes the door.]
ROSS: [reading his list] Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two:
how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're
nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how
great you are with Ben. 
[Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe enter, confused.]
ROSS: Number six: the way you smell.
JOEY: [opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
ROSS: Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
JOEY: Oh, yeah, I do.
[He opens the window, Ross comes in, soaked.]
CHAN: What are you doing out there?
ROSS: I am, uh, I am...
MNCA: Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup
of hot Mockolate?
[Ross runs to Rachel's bedroom, knocking on the door.]
ROSS: Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another
chance.
[Rachel opens the door.]
RACH: No.
ROSS: No?
RACH: That's what I said.
CHAN: Look, maybe we should go?
RACH: No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
ROSS: Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
RACH: [near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about
yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world
not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
ROSS: No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
RACH: Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't
go!
ROSS: You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's
nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
RACH: Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
[She closes the door in his face. Ross walks sullenly back to the couch and sits down.
A moment of silence ensues.]
JOEY: [quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a
situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little
longer.
[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]
MNCA: Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh,
like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and
four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
RTST: Doesn't matter.
MNCA: What?
RTST: Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
MNCA: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
RTST: Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. [hands it to her] Thank you for all the
trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking,
did you?
MNCA: Well, uh, I ate some.
RTST: Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when
you pee, does it?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Rachel are there.]
(phone rings)
MNCA: Hello?
[Ross is at his apartment.]
ROSS: Hi.
RACH: [to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are
weighin' me down.
MNCA: [to Ross] Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
ROSS: Look, can, can you do something for me?
MNCA: Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music?
[Monica turns on the radio.]
RADIO: The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's
deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. (With
or Without You plays) 
[Rachel seems touched. She pauses for a moment, then picks up the phone and starts to
dial. Cut to Ross at his apartment.]
RADIO: Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's
pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why
don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit
you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]
RTST: Hi, thanks for coming in again.
MNCA: Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
RTST: It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called
"fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of
reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
MNCA: Cat hair.
RTST: Oh, sorry.

END[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Rachel, Ross, and Phoebe
are there. Phoebe is looking out the window.]

PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you
should see the size of his Christmas Balls.

[Chandler and Joey enter.]

JOEY: Hey.

CHANDLER: Hey.

RACHEL: Hey.

JOEY: Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?

CHANDLER: Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look
bad.

MONICA: Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.

CHANDLER: And twenty-five it is.

JOEY: You gave him cookies?

MONICA: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're
broke, but cookies do say that.

PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.

CHANDLER: Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?

PHOEBE: Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.

ROSS: So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?

RACHEL: Uhh, the mailman, the super.

[There's a bang at the door.]

MONICA: Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.

[Joey opens the door and picks up the remnants of the newspaper.

JOEY: Oh my God.

RACHEL: What?

JOEY: Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.

[Joey shows them the torn-up newspaper.]

RACHEL: Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.

MONICA: Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.

ROSS: Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is
bitemebitemebitemebiteme.

OPENING TITLES

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Chandler, and Joey are seated at couches. Rachel is
working behind the counter.]

JOEY: I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey,
the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.

CHANDLER: Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.

[Ross enters with several bags from shopping.]

ROSS: Hey guys.

CHANDLER, MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.

[Ross approaches Rachel at counter.]

ROSS: Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. [Rachel is not impressed]. . I'll open
it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. [sings] Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs,
everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of
the whole. . .

RACHEL: Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?

ROSS: How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off]
Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?

GUNTHER: Yeah.

ROSS: Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the couches]

ROSS: Hey guys.

CHANDLER, MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.

CHANDLER: What's in the bag?

ROSS: Um, just some presents.

JOEY: C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.

ROSS: [childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.

MONICA: Cute.

ROSS: I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse
for mom.

[Ross holds up the blouse. It is extremely tacky, with sewn-on medals hanging off of it.]

MONICA: Ross, that is gorgeous!

ROSS: Yeah?

MONICA: Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed
at the make-believe military academy.

[Phoebe enters.]

PHOEBE: Hey.

GANG: Hey. Hi Phoebe.

PHOEBE: Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get
this?

ROSS: Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.

PHOEBE: This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.

CHANDLER: Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.

PHOEBE: No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.

RACHEL: Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.

PHOEBE: No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.

RACHEL: How have you never been on Oprah?

PHOEBE: [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture
before she died, same guy.

MONICA: Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue
screen with a collie.

PHOEBE: It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK,
I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]

MONICA: Oh, wait a minute honey.

GANG: Phoebs. [Phoebe leaves]

MONICA: Wow.

JOEY: So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .

GANG: Joey!

JOEY: Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!

[Scene: Phoebe's grandmother's place. Phoebe's grandmother is sitting at the table,
reading the obituaries, and crossing out names in the phonebook.]

GRANDMOTHER: Esther Livingston. [scratches out name] Gone.

[Phoebe enters.]

GRANDMOTHER: Hi, Phoe.

PHOEBE: Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?

GRANDMOTHER: Oh, just updating the phonebook.

PHOEBE: Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?

GRANDMOTHER: [nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?

PHOEBE: Just, you know, to see... um.

GRANDMOTHER: Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father
in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . .
another graduation. . . another graduation.

PHOEBE: OK, is this really my father?

GRANDMOTHER: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.

PHOEBE: OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.

GRANDMOTHER: Look, I. . .

PHOEBE: Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you
have never lied to me.

GRANDMOTHER: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.

PHOEBE: Oh God.

GRANDMOTHER: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real
father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it,
but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but
harder.

PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he
doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

GRANDMOTHER: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?

GRANDMOTHER: Honey.

PHOEBE: [realizes] Oh.

GRANDMOTHER: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a
picture out] This is the real him.

PHOEBE: Oh.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel, Chandler, and Joey are decorating the
Christmas tree.]

CHANDLER: Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black
boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to
see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.

RACHEL: Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.

CHANDLER: Who said anything about Christmas?

[Monica and Ross enter.]

MONICA: Hi.

ROSS: Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

RACHEL: No, nothin'.

MONICA: I hope she's OK.

JOEY: Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.

MONICA: How do you know exactly what she's going through?

JOEY: She told us.

CHANDLER: So whaddya got there Monica?

MONICA: Just some stuff for the party.

ROSS: Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?

MONICA: You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya
gonna do?

CHANDLER: Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

RACHEL: Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the
ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]

MONICA: Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.

JOEY: Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.

[Ross approaches Rachel, away from everyone else.]
ROSS: Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better.
How 'bout you make a list about me.

RACHEL: Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .

ROSS: C'mon Rachel.

RACHEL: OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're
gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You
like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much
of that gel in your hair.

ROSS: See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.

RACHEL: Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she
walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]

[Scene: Back at Phoebe's. She is on the phone]

PHOEBE: Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica.
. . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself
information. [hangs up]

[Phoebe's grandmother enters]

GRANDMOTHER: Hey.

PHOEBE: Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.

GRANDMOTHER: C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?

PHOEBE: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.

GRANDMOTHER: Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy
but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her
Gremlin.

PHOEBE: No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.

GRANDMOTHER: I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I
didn't know exactly where he lived.

PHOEBE: Whattaya mean?

GRANDMOTHER: He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've
gone too far. You can take my cab.

PHOEBE: Wow. Thank you.

GRANDMOTHER: Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.

PHOEBE: Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to
a picture of Einstein]


Commercial
[Scene: Chandler is standing on a street corner waiting for Phoebe in the cab. Joey
walks up.]

JOEY: Phoebe here with the cab yet?

CHANDLER: Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.

JOEY: Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.

CHANDLER: Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll
meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.

[Phoebe drives up in the cab]

JOEY: Hey, here she comes.

Chandler: Hey.

JOEY: Hey.

[Phoebe runs over the curb. Joey gets in the back seat, Chandler in the front]

PHOEBE: Hey.

JOEY: Hey.

PHOEBE: Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.

CHANDLER: Eeeshk.

JOEY: Yeah, big stuff.

PHOEBE: OK, let's go.

CHANDLER: OK.

PHOEBE: Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]

CHANDLER: OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?

PHOEBE: Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

CHANDLER: [grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?

PHOEBE: Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
[Chandler jumps out of the car]

CHANDLER: [Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!

JOEY: Hey. [Phoebe takes off, Joey and Chandler are thrown back in the seat]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica is preparing for the party with Ross
questioning her.]

ROSS: C'mon, just tell me, please, please.

MONICA: For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.

[Rachel enters from her room]

RACHEL: Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.

MONICA: Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross,
could you turn the heat down please?

ROSS: Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .

MONICA: Ross, the heat!

ROSS: Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. [goes to the radiator and
starts turning the knob] OK, this way is on, so this is. . . [breaks off the knob] off.

RACHEL: Did you just break the radiator?

ROSS: No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.

MONICA: Well put it back.

ROSS: It uhh, it won't go back.

RACHEL: I'll call the super.

MONICA: Here, let me try.

ROSS: Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

MONICA: Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.

RACHEL: [on phone] Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody,
uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough
to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday,
we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.

ROSS: OK, tip the man.

MONICA: No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look
if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.

ROSS: Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.

[Scene: Outside Phoebe's dad's house. The cab pulls up.]

PHOEBE: Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the
plexiglass wall in the cab]

CHANDLER: Oh, so that's what this is for.

PHOEBE: Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.

CHANDLER: Yeah.

JOEY: Sure is.

PHOEBE: OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.

CHANDLER: Alright.

JOEY: Good luck Phoebs.

PHOEBE: OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. [she just sits in the cab]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. They are having their party. All the guests are
stripped down because of the heat.]

RACHEL: [answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats
and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.

ROSS: [sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I
use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that
be too much?

MONICA: [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.

ROSS: Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.

MONICA: Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey,
hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]

RACHEL: [answering the door] Mr. Treeger.

MR. TREEGER: Uhh, you said there was a party.

RACHEL: Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.

MR. TREEGER: Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much
skin. Hey, cheese!

[Ross is speaking to Monica and Rachel about tipping the super.]
ROSS: Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your
earrings. Something, now, anything.

MONICA: No, I will not cave.

RACHEL: Yeah, I'm with Mon.

ROSS: Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even
though he's your super, I'm seizing. [approaches Mr. Treeger] Mr. Treeger, here is 50
bucks, merry Christmas.

[Gives him the cash.]
MR. TREEGER: Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.

ROSS: No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a
chance you could fix that radiator now?

MR. TREEGER: No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.

MONICA: Ross.

ROSS: Yeah.

MONICA: [to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.

ROSS: You mean hardball?

MONICA: Whatever.

RACHEL: What'cha gonna' do?

ROSS: Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh,
will this help with the knob getting?

MR. TREEGER: No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.

MONICA: So, wait, you really did like my cookies?

MR. TREEGER: Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.

RACHEL: Nice seizing. . . gel boy.

MR. TREEGER: [to Rachel who is standing under mistletoe] So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?

RACHEL: Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.

MR. TREEGER: Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.

RACHEL: Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.

[Scene: Outside Phoebe's dad's house. Phoebe is running back to the cab.]

PHOEBE: OK.

JOEY: How far'd ya get?

PHOEBE: Mailbox.

CHANDLER: Alright, we're gettin' closer.

PHOEBE: Uh-huh.

JOEY: Phoebs, what's goin' on?

PHOEBE: No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like,
yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now
he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .

JOEY: Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.

PHOEBE: Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me
and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really
nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.

CHANDLER: Well, so why not go knock?

PHOEBE: Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what
if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've
already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

JOEY: Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.

PHOEBE: Yeah?

CHANDLER: Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.

JOEY: Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.

PHOEBE: You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.

CHANDLER: Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.

JOEY: Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright
if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a
blank canvas.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross, Monica, and Rachel are sitting around after
the party. Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe enter.]

CHANDLER: Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!

JOEY: Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?

MONICA: Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.

ROSS: Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.

PHOEBE: Oh, I couldn't go in.

MONICA: Honey, I'm sorry.

ROSS: Are you OK?

PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for
now.

CHANDLER: Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug,
Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]

JOEY: Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope
that's alright.

CLOSING TITLES

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Chandler are giving out their Christmas
presents out of a cardboard box from a case of motor oil.]

JOEY: Rach, these are for you.

RACHEL: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

JOEY: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.

CHANDLER: OK, Phoebs, your turn.

PHOEBE: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?

JOEY: Uh-huh.

PHOEBE: You guuuyys.

JOEY: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.

ROSS: You got me a cola drink?

CHANDLER: And, a lemon lime.

ROSS: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.

CHANDLER: And last but not least.

[Chandler and Joey give Monica a pack of condoms.]
JOEY: They're ribbed for your pleasure.

[Ross and Monica trade their gifts.]
END[The gang is walking to a newsstand late at night. Joey is anxiously in the lead.]
RACH: Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock
in the morning.
JOEY: I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
MNCA: You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
PHOE: Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time.
Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.
JOEY: Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the
mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of
the king.
CHAN: OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
PHOE: OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
CHAN: Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
ROSS: I don't want to.
RACH: Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
ROSS: Yeah.
JOEY: Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere.
There's gotta be a reason.
ROSS: Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
JOEY: No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
MNCA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this
will change your mind. [Reads from paper] In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able
to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...[turns it] sucking.

[Scene: Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica comforting Joey at Monica and Rachel's
apartment.]
JOEY: When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to
put your hands into cows and stuff.
[Ross enters, depressed.]
ROSS: [sullenly] Hiiiiii.
PHOE: Are... are you OK?
ROSS: Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid.
Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He,
he's here, isn't he?
MNCA: Maybe.
ROSS: Don't toy with me.
[Fun Bobby (FBOB) enters from Monica's bedroom.]
FBOB: Geller!
ROSS: Hey, Fun Bobby!
FBOB: Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
ROSS: Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my
sister!
MNCA: You and me both.
FBOB: Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
PHOE: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
FBOB: Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
JOEY: No, I'm alright man. Really.
FBOB: No, I'm picking you up.
JOEY: Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off
the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.
FBOB: OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? [everyone raises
their hands] I'm still gonna go.
MNCA: OK, I'll see you later babe.
FBOB: Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. [kisses
Monica]
[Chandler and Joey are watching, Rachel turns their heads away from Monica.]
FBOB: See ya. [exits]
ALL: Bye! See you later!
PHOE: Fun Bobby is so great.
MNCA: Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I
mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of
months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
PHOE: Half full of looooovvvvve.
MNCA: And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for
the weekend.
PHOE: Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
RACH: We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table,
holding five empty wine bottles]
MNCA: Really? I only had two glasses.
JOEY: I just had a glass.
PHOE: Two.
RACH: I had one glass.
CHAN: I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural
History' mug.
RACH: OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
[All look towards door Fun Bobby left through.]
ROSS: Oooooh.
JOEY: [realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.
MNCA: So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
ROSS: Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun
Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
PHOE: Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories
with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh,
'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
JOEY: Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
MNCA: Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how
do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
[Scene: Monica, Fun Bobby, and Phoebe sitting in Central Perk Rachel is serving
them. She brings a mug to Monica.]
MNCA: Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
RACH: Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
MNCA: [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.
RACH: Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
FBOB: [pulls out a flask] Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
[Phoebe and Rachel look uncomfortable.]
PHOE: Um, cake.
RACH: Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to
counter.]
MNCA: You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish
lately.
FBOB: Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
MNCA: Bobby.
FBOB: Yeah, OK.
MNCA: Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh,
I'm kind of worried about you.
FBOB: OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this,
but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social
drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
MNCA: So, what are you saying now?
FBOB: I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
[they hug]
PHOE: [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
FBOB: I am gonna try and quit drinking.
PHOE: [sad] Ooohh, why?
[Chandler and Joey enter.]
CHAN: Hey.
JOEY: Hey.
MNCA: Hey.
PHOE: Hey.
CHAN: Guess who's back in show business.
PHOE: Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
CHAN: No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
PHOE: Oh, no.
CHAN: OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
JOEY: Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
PHOE: Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a
soap opera theme.
CHAN: Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
PHOE: Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
RACH: Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
MNCA: [gasps] You have other friends?
RACH: Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
MNCA: What?
JOEY: With a man?
RACH: What? What is so strange about me having a date?
JOEY: What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about
you?
RACH: Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him
anymore.
MNCA: What are you talking about?
RACH: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
PHOE: But you guys came so close.
RACH: Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact
that I will not be dating Ross.
[Russ enters Central Perk. He looks like Ross, except for his chin and hair (it
is David Schwimmer in a dual role).]
RACH: Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
RUSS: [sounding like Ross] Hhhhiiiii.
[Everyone looks at each other in amazement.]
[Scene: Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Estelle (ESTL) is speaking on the phone.]
ESTL: Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird
dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? [a knock
on the door] Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
[Joey enters.]
ESTL: Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
JOEY: Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
ESTL: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
JOEY: No.
ESTL: Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]
JOEY: OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network
casting lady...
ESTL: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
JOEY: Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort
of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if
I would have sent the Little General in.
ESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's
goin' on and straighten it out. [picks up the phone] Yeah, hi, Lori please. [pause] Hi
darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific?
[pause] Uh-huuuuh. [pause] Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. [hangs up] [to Joey]
Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel at counter, Phoebe, Chandler, and Fun
Bobby at the couch.]
RACH: What's the matter?
MNCA: It's Fun Bobby.
RACH: What, isn't he sober?
MNCA: Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
RACH: Ohhh, OK.
[Monica returns to couch next to Fun Bobby.]
MNCA: Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]
FBOB: Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
MNCA: Oh God, yes!
FBOB: There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
PHOE: That is funny.
FBOB: I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the
neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the
Village.
MNCA: Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
FBOB: Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]
CHAN: Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
MNCA: Oh.... my... God.
PHOE: It's not that bad.
MNCA: Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
PHOE: OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
RACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
MNCA: But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with
him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
PHOE: Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set
it free.
[Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]
RUSS: Hi.
CHAN: [turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
RACH: Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
RUSS: OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
[Phoebe walks up to Rachel, cleaning tables.]
PHOE: Rachel? Um, hi.
RACH: Hi.
PHOE: OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
RACH: Uhh.... waitressing?
PHOE: Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of
someone?
RACH: [looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?
PHOE: [looks at Russ] Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
[Phoebe turns back around but Rachel is gone. Ross enters.]
PHOE: Oh, my, oh!
ROSS: What? What's wrong?
PHOE: I, OK....
MNCA: She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this
morning.
ROSS: Alright.
CHAN: [to Phoebe] Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. [introducing Russ and Ross]
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
RUSS: Hi.
ROSS: Hi.
RUSS: Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
ROSS: Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
RUSS: Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of
Rachel's.
ROSS: A date.
RUSS: Yeah, I'm her date.
ROSS: Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
CHAN: You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
RUSS: Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
ROSS: Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
RUSS: Periodontist.
MNCA: See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
ROSS: Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting
you.
RUSS: Ditto.
[ROss approaches Rachel at counter.]
ROSS: I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
RACH: Oh.
ROSS: Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
RACH: Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
ROSS: Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of
moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to
me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if
this is the deal...
RACH: Well, yeah, this is the deal.
ROSS: OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
RACH: Um, Russ, you ready?
RUSS: Yeah.
RACH: Bye.
MNCA: Bye.
PHOE: Bye.
[Russ and Rachel leave together.]
ROSS: [upset] She's dating. She's dating.
CHAN: Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
ROSS: What do you mean?
MNCA: Do you not see it?
ROSS: See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him,
what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a
sentence.
CHAN: Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
ROSS: ....................Yeah.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is making marinara sauce and filling every
container in sight. Chandler enters.]
CHAN: Hey.
JOEY: Hey.
CHAN: Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and
said it was hungry.
JOEY: Well, the part's mine if I want it.
CHAN: Oh my God!
JOEY: Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
CHAN: [not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?
JOEY: Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days
of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
CHAN: So, what're you gonna do?
JOEY: Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
CHAN: Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
JOEY: I've never slept with someone for a part.
CHAN: Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out,
covered with pasta sauce]
JOEY: Sorry.
CHAN: It's alright. Is she good-looking?
JOEY: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something,
I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.
CHAN: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it
is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and
a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
JOEY: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean,
let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because
of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
CHAN: Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
JOEY: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
[Scene: A restaurant. Fun Bobby and Monica are ordering.]
WAITER: Can I get you something from the bar?
MNCA: Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank
you.
FBOB: If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
MNCA: No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.
FBOB: So the light went out in my refrigerator...
MNCA: [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler is sitting on the couch between Russ and Ross,
doing a crossword puzzle.]
CHAN: Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK...
eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
RUSS: Dysprosium.
ROSS: [condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
CHAN: And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White
Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
[Phoebe and Rachel are at the counter talking.]
PHOE: You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
RACH: What?
PHOE: OK honey, you're dating Ross.
RACH: No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
PHOE: Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
RACH: Steve... sleeve!
PHOE: OK, noone is named Sleeve.
RACH: Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being
similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
[They look over at Russ and Ross.]
ROSS: [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
RUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
CHAN: OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
RUSS: I know what your problem is.
ROSS: Oh you do, do you?
RUSS: Um-hum, you're jealous.
ROSS: Of... of what?
RUSS: You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
ROSS: Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major
in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
RUSS: Hey, you listen.
ROSS: No, no, let me finish.
RUSS: No, let me finish.
ROSS: No, you let me fini...
[Rachel walks up behind them.]
ROSS: Hi.
RUSS: Hi.
RACH: Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! [turns away]
[Scene: Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, and Chandler at Monica and Rachel's apartment.]
RACH: Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
CHAN: No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great
job?
RACH: I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
CHAN: Me.
RACH: Why would I have to sleep with you?
CHAN: It's my game. You want the job or not?
[Monica enters from her bedroom.]
CHAN: Hey.
MNCA: Morning.
ROSS: Where ya goin'?
MNCA: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
ROSS: Ooooohhhh.
[Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]
PHOE: What's with all the bottles of liquor?
ROSS: What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
MNCA: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I
find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
[Three slow knocks on the door.]
RACH: Oh God, even his knock is boring.
[Monica answers the door. Its Fun Bobby.]
MNCA: Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
FBOB: Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
MNCA: Sure.
[They both step out into the hall.]
FBOB: This is really hard for me to say.
MNCA: Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
FBOB: Oh, no, no, it's about you.
MNCA: What about me?
FBOB: I think you may have a drinking problem.
MNCA: What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and
scrapes.
FBOB: Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now,
OK?
MNCA: Oh... shoot.
FBOB: Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
MNCA: OK.
[They hug and kiss.]
MNCA: Take care.
FBOB: You too.
[Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]
RACH: What happened?
MNCA: Well we... we kinda broke up.
GANG: Awwwwwwww.
[Ross, Phoebe, Chandler, and Rachel all exchange money.]
MNCA: [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?
CHAN: I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
[Joey enters.]
JOEY: Hey.
GANG: Hey!
ROSS: How'd the callback go?
JOEY: It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
CHAN: So what'd you do?
JOEY: Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
ROSS: Good for you.
JOEY: But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the
elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
PHOE: So... and?
JOEY: Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at
least four episodes!
GANG: Allright!
JOEY: Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves]
[Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Chandler exchange money again.]
Credits [Scene: Central Perk. Russ enters. Chandler and
Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]
RUSS: Hi.
CHAN: Oh, hey.
PHOE: Hi.
RUSS: I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
CHAN: Yeah, I'm sorry man.
RUSS: Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea
who she's talking about?
[Chandler and Phoebe feign ignorance.]
PHOE: Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
RUSS: Oh.
[Julie... Ross's ex-girlfriend... enters.]
JULIE: Hey.
CHAN: Hey!
PHOE: Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
JULIE: Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I
guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
[Russ and Julie look at each other with love in their eyes. The music builds...]
END[at Ross's. Carol and Susan are picking Ben up]
ROSS: Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
CAROL: So how did everything go?
ROSS: Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he
started it.
CAROL: Well, we've gotta go.
ROSS: Ok.
SUSAN: [clears her throat]
CAROL: Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
ROSS: Oh, you and me?
CAROL: Uh, no, Susan and me.
SUSAN: The other us.
ROSS: Ok.
CAROL: We're uh, we're getting married.
ROSS: As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
CAROL: Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
ROSS: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
CAROL: Look I just thought that...
ROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about
me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
SUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?
ROSS: Mmm hmmm.
CAROL: Want us to go?
ROSS: Uh-huh.
[at Rachel and Monica's]
ROSS: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
JOEY: It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I
started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
MONICA: Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and
she's in a full body cast.
ROSS, CHANDLER & JOEY: Yes!
MONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered
before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
ROSS: Would it matter?
MONICA: Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!
JOEY: Are you really not going?
ROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they
need to get married?
MONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that
are close with them.
ROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.
CHANDLER: [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the
bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
MONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.
ROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were
marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
RACHEL: [entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
JOEY: No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
CHANDLER: Whoa, she's pretty.
JOEY: Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras,
and smell-the-fart acting.
RACHEL: I'm sorry, what?
MONICA: What?
JOEY: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a
minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause
where you look all intense, you know, like this. 
CHANDLER: Oh, ok.
JOEY: There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm
Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. 
MRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?
JOEY: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering
from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
CHANDLER: Nice!
RACHEL: That's great!
ROSS: Excellent!
CHANDLER: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
[Monica and Rachel's]
ROSS: That is so good! Do it again!
JOEY: All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the
chart!"
CHANDLER: That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to
inspect.
ROSS: No no, that's me.
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah. 
ROSS: Oh, hello.
PHOEBE: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
ROSS: Is everything ok?
PHOEBE: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
ROSS: Oh my god.
CHANDLER: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
PHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
MONICA: Oh, honey.
PHOEBE: Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought,
"ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have
my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh,
but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the
spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
RACHEL: What do you mean?
PHOEBE: I think it went into me.
[Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe]
[Central Perk]
MONICA: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
CHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called
Silence of the Ducks.
RACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?
ROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
CHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
RACHEL: Oh god.
JOEY: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
RACHEL: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think
that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman
tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
PHOEBE: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs.
Adelman's voice] Sit up!
MRS. GREEN: [entering] There she is.
RACHEL: Mom!
MRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
RACHEL: Pretty much.
MRS GREEN: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
RACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
MRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross. 
ROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]
MRS GREEN: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
RACHEL: Oh Mom!
MRS GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
CHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens.
MRS GREEN: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my
father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
RACHEL: Really?
MRS GREEN: Yes.
PHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she
got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
JOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
PHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
[at Rachel and Monica's
MRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
RACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
MRS GREEN: [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.
RACHEL: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry
and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is
just so much better for me, you know?
MRS GREEN: I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at
you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
RACHEL: For...me.
MRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.
RACHEL: Well, what do you mean?
MRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
MONICA: [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding,
chicken breasts.
RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
ROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
RACHEL: None.
JOEY: They didn't fight a lot?
RACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they
were having problems?
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.
JOEY: Hey, look who's up.
RACHEL: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's
parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about
this.
MONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's
doing it because she wants to be more like you.
RACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
CHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this
shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your
case it's actually kinda true.
PHOEBE: That's him.
CHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
MR A: Phoebe?
PHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
MR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
PHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit?
MR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can
I do for you, my dear?
PHOEBE: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her
body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
MR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?
PHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished
business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
MR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that
she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
PHOEBE: Everything?
MR A: Everything.
PHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
MR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
MR A: [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?
[Joey nods and shrugs.]
MRS GREEN: Look at this.
RACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.
MRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
RACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a
regular dentist.
MONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really
need your help"?
RACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell
out of my kitchen."
MONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I
planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually
do it.
RACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?
MONICA: If you want.
PHOEBE: [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern
Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
RACHEL: She's still with you?
PHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go
to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's
voice] Oh, such a pretty face.
MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does
anybody have any marijuana?
RACHEL: God!
MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. 
MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex?
MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.
MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there
might be more.
RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean,
god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What?
What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
MRS GREEN: No.
RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it?
MRS GREEN: No.
RACHEL: Then what? What do you want?
MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this?
MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
RACHEL: Oh.
MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes
left. Move, move, move!
CHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
MONICA: Joey, speed it up!
JOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
PHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
PHOEBE: Sir! No sir!
MONICA: [to Ross] All right, you!
ROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
MONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and
I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those
little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All
right, ball the melon.
CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
[knock at the door]
MONICA: Hi.
CAROL: How's it going?
MONICA: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone
groans]
CAROL: Fine, whatever.
ROSS: What's the matter?
CAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
ROSS: What?
MONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
ROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
CAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
ROSS: Oh my god.
CAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my
parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
ROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.
CAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call
off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and
if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to
do.
ROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
CAROL: You do?
ROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
CAROL: Of course I do.
ROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell
with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped
me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
CAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.
MONICA: So we're back on?
CAROL: We're back on.
MONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
[at the wedding]
JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like
Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my
lesbian wedding.
[Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry
later.
[Monica pushes Ben down the aisle in a stroller. Susan is escorted by both her
parents. Carol is escorted by Ross.]
CAROL: Thank you.
ROSS: Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]
CAROL: Ross. [He lets her go]
MINISTER: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people,
come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's
voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
[At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture
taken.]
MONICA: Would you look at them?
ROSS: Yeah, can't help but.
JOEY: [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the
guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.
PHOEBE: I miss Rose. 
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah? 
PHOEBE: I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you
know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
WOMAN: You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think
it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a
drink?
PHOEBE: Ok, that's so nice.
[Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe
doesn't see him.]
CHANDLER: [to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a
line, right? [The woman walks away]
RACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun?
MRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other
girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue,
but it's nice to know I have options.
RACHEL: There's more alcohol, right?
[Susan approaches Ross, who's looking lonely]
SUSAN: How you doin'?
ROSS: Ok.
SUSAN: You did a good thing today.
ROSS: Yeah.
SUSAN: You wanna dance?
ROSS: No, that's fine.
SUSAN: Come on. I'll let you lead.
ROSS: Ok.
[They dance; Carol looks on lovingly.]
CHANDLER: [to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis.
We're all people. [She walks away again.]
[at Monica and Rachel's]
MONICA: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
ROSS: Well, Mon, I was married.
PHOEBE: Yeah, me, too, technically.
RACHEL: I had a wedding.
MONICA: All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
JOEY: I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They
all look at Chandler]
CHANDLER: Isn't Ben in this?
ALL: Oh, yeah!

END[Scene: In a TV commercial that the gang is watching at Monica and
Rachel's.]

[A guy is sitting at his desk and his boss comes in and drops a huge pile of papers on
his desk. The guy looks dejected.]

COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...

[A monkey jumps on the desk and hands the guy a beer. He opens the beer and is suddenly on
the beach, in a hammock, with beautiful women all around.]

COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: ...With MonkeyShine Beer. [MonkeyShine theme] MonkeyShine Beer,
'cause it's a jungle out there.]

[Camera pans back from the TV to show the gang watching.]

ROSS: That commercial always makes me so sad.

JOEY: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything
seems to work out OK.

ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.

PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the
little pouty chin.
MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.

ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.

RACHEL: Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a
Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

ROSS: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd
be little monkey raisins in it.

CHANDLER: Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. .
. all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.

OPENING TITLES 

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are at the couch.] 

[Joey enters holding a letter]

JOEY: Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.

CHANDLER: Rhythm?

JOEY: No, my first fan mail.

ALL: Alright!

MONICA: [reading] 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have
you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please
find 14 of my eyelashes.'

RACHEL: Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.

MONICA: This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your
apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.

JOEY: Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.

[Ross enters with a suitcase]

ROSS: Hey guys.

ALL: Hey.

PHOEBE: Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?

ROSS: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then
drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

CHANDLER: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh,
you know, isn't capable of that emotion.

[Rob (Chris Isaac) enters]

RACHEL: Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.

PHOEBE: Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's
really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.

[Everyone laughs]

PHOEBE: I know, I know. [to Rob] Hello.

ROB: Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.

PHOEBE: Hi Rob Dohnen.

ROB: I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.

PHOEBE: Oh, wow.

ROB: Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was
just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?

PHOEBE: Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs
that I will write for them.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are standing around in the
kitchen.]

JOEY: Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?

CHANDLER: Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. [both laugh hysterically]

[door buzzer goes off]

CHANDLER: Hello.

ERICA: It's Erica.

JOEY: Ah, the stalker.

ERICA: Never mind, it's open.

CHANDLER: [Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We
might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.

JOEY: Let's get out of here.

[They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel's door]

CHANDLER: The one time they're not home.

JOEY: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me
'cause we've never met.
CHANDLER: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.

JOEY: She's comin'.

[Both run back in their apartment. There's a knock at the door.]

ERICA: It's me.

JOEY: Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?

CHANDLER: Wait, wait, wait. [Opens the top of the dish soap he's holding]

[Joey opens the door and sees Erica (Brooke Shields). Joey gets a huge smile and Chandler
squeezed the dish soap in the air.]

ERICA: Hi.

JOEY: Erica.

[Scene: San Diego Zoo. Ross is at the Monkey cages.]

LIPSON: Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.

ROSS: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan,
answers to the name Marcel.

LIPSON: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.

ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?

LIPSON: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then
he died.

ROSS: I can't believe this.

LIPSON: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.'
It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.

ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.

LIPSON: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.

ROSS: Zoo dollars?

LIPSON: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

[Scene: Library. Phoebe is getting ready to sing for the kids. Chandler, Monica, and
Rachel are there.]

[Phoebe pulls out her guitar]

KIDS: Ooohhh.

PHOEBE: I know.

MONICA: I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.

CHANDLER: Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?

RACHEL AND MONICA: Yeah.

CHANDLER: Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.

RACHEL: And she's not crazy?

CHANDLER: Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr.
Drake Remore.

RACHEL: Oh my God.

MONICA: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.

CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the
magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not
deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one
who wants to boff the maniac.

ROB: You OK?

PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture
them all in their underwear.

ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.

PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just,
grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This
is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?

ROSS: I was thinkin' about it.

PHOEBE: OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe

ALL: Hi Phoebe.

PHOEBE: OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. [singing]
Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes,
she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike.
But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner,
And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.
Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru,
but the truth is she died and some day you will too.
La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...

[Scene: A nice restraunt. Joey and Erica are dining.]

ERICA: Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?

JOEY: Yeah it is. . . what?

ERICA: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching
someone's spinal cord.

JOEY: Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours,
but they only showed it for 2 minites.

ERICA: Who's they?

JOEY: No one.

ERICA: Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these
beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.

JOEY: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]

ERICA: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to
be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?

JOEY: Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at
that.

[Some guy at another table starts choking]

WAITER: Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?

ERICA: Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.

[Scene: San Diege Zoo. Ross is still at the monkey cages. A janitor is sweeping.]

JANITOR: Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.

ROSS: Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um,
zoo dollars?

JANITOR: It's about your monkey. It's alive.

[Scene: Restraunt. Joey and Erica are still there.]

ERICA: I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?

JOEY: Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal
chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.

ERICA: No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?

JOEY: But that's what...

ERICA: I should just be happy to be near you.

JOEY: Hey I- [she cuts him off with a kiss]

ERICA: Hey what?

JOEY: That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! [she starts nibbling his hand]
Hey. He-hey.

[Scene: Library. Phoebe is singing.]

PHOEBE: [singing] There'll be times when you get older
when you'll want to sleep with people
just to make them like you. . .
But don't.
Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody
That's another thing that you don't wanna do.

MONICA: Excellent!

CHANDLER: Very informative!

RACHEL: Not at all inappropriate!

PHOEBE: Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.

ROB: That was great, the kids loved you.

PHOEBE: Yay, I rock.

ROB: And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the
truth.You were incredible.

PHOEBE: But.

ROB: How did you know there was a but?

PHOEBE: I sense these things. It was either but or butter.

ROB: The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play
more songs about like, barnyard animals.

PHOEBE: I can do that.

ROB: Really?

PHOEBE: Yeah.

ROB: Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?

PHOEBE: Thinkin' about it.

[Scene: San Diego Zoo. Ross and the janitor are in the nocturnal house.]

JANITOR: Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged
messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.

ROSS: Buddy, my monkey?

JANITOR: Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey
was taken.

ROSS: Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.

JANITOR: The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?

ROSS: That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.

JANITOR: Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's
all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?

ROSS: That guy Lipson?

JANITOR: Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?

ROSS: No, I, I only know Lipson.

JANITOR: Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down
denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...

ROSS: Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.

JANITOR: Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets
they have here at the zoo.

ROSS: Of course.

JANITOR: Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.

ROSS: This is unbelievable.

JANITOR: So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?

ROSS: Are you trying to get me to bribe you?

JANITOR: Maybe.

ROSS: But you already told me everything.

[Scene: Library. Ross show up with a MonkeyShine Beer poster.]

ROSS: Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.

RACHEL: Well, so what're you gonna do?

ROSS: Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.

CHANDLER: That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.

PHOEBE: OK, hi again.

ALL: Hi Phoebe.

PHOEBE: Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
[singing] Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo,
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo.
Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up,
And that's how we get hamburgers.
Nooowww, chickens!

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Monica, Rachel, and the guys are watching Days
of Our Lives.]

TV DOCTOR: You're the only one who can save her Drake.

JOEY ON TV: Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.

ROSS: Well, there goes my whole belief system.

[knock at the door]

ERICA: It's Erica.

JOEY: Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.

RACHEL: No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.

JOEY: Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.

RACHEL: Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?

MONICA: Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.

JOEY: Hey Erica, c'mon in.

ERICA: How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?

JOEY: Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?

ERICA: Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?

JOEY: Who?

ERICA: Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.

JOEY: It's not what you think, that was...

ERICA: You told me I was the only one. [throws a glass of water in his face]

JOEY: Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright.
Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK.
I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.

ERICA: Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?

JOEY: Somebody wanna help me out here?

RACHEL: Oh, I know, I know. [Turns on the TV. Joey in on it.]

ERICA: How, how can you be here and there.

JOEY: 'Cause it's a television show.

ERICA: Drake, what're you getting at?

JOEY: I'm not Drake.

ROSS: That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.

ERICA: Is this true?

RACHEL: Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to,
to sleep with me. [throws water in his face]

MONICA: And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his
face]

CHANDLER: And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. [throws water in his face]

ERICA: Is all this true?

JOEY: Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with
the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy
for you.

ERICA: Oh Hans. [They kiss]

ROSS: Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.

JOEY: Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care

ERICA: I'll never forget you Hans. [Joey shuts the door in her face]

JOEY: OK, alright, the people who threw the water.

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Rob are sitting on the couch.]

PHOEBE: Fired! Why?

ROB: The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in
your songs.

PHOEBE: I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?

ROB: No.

PHOEBE: I see.

ROB: Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.

PHOEBE: No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple
dinosaur?

ROB: I'm not saying you have to be Barney.

PHOEBE: Who's Barney.

[Scene: Central Perk. The whole gang is there.]

ROSS: Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right
here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.

RACHEL: You're kidding.

JOEY: This is amazing.

ROSS: I know.

JOEY: I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.

PHOEBE: OK, Rachel, I'm ready.

RACHEL: OK.

[little kid enters]

KID: Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?

PHOEBE: Um, yeah I guess that's me.

KID: [shouting out the door] She's here.

[a rush of kids enter]

PHOEBE: [singing] Sometimes men love women,
sometimes men love men,
and then there are bisexuals,
though some just say they're kidding themselves.
la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...

[Scene: City street. The whole gang is walking up to the movie set.]

ROSS: This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.

CHANDLER: What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one
joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?

SECURITY GUARD: C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

ROSS: Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?

SECURITY GUARD: I'm sorry guys, closed set.

ROSS: Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used
to live together.

SECURITY GUARD: Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.

MONICA: Ross, there he is.

ROSS: Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. [Marcel doesn't react so Ross starts singing] In
the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. [no reaction from Marcel,
Monica and Joey urge him on] In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight.
[Marcel looks over and everyone joins in] a-weema-way, a-weema-way..... [Marcel
runs over and hops up on Ross's shoulder]

[Scene: The next time at the movie set.]

SECURITY GUARD: Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...

JOEY: Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in]

ROSS: Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
[Marcel grabs the elephant doll and throws it to the ground]

JOEY: Woah, dude, burn.

ROSS: I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.

TRAINER: Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a
movie and all.

RACHEL: Now just how big of a star is Marcel?

TRAINER: In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.

ALL: Woah.

CHANDLER: [to guys wering yellow isolation suits] So, are you guys in the movie, or are
you just really paranoid.

DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway
set?

JOEY: Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?

DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: The one in the director's chair.

JOEY: Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.

PHOEBE: OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?

JOEY: Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible
flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he
lookin'?

SUSIE: We've got a problem.

DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Tell me.

SUSIE: I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.

DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Is it bad?

SUSIE: It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to
let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.

DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: I'll talk to her.

SUSIE: I hate actors.

CHANDLER: [to an extra in fatigues] Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost
didn't see ya.

SUSIE: Excuse me.

CHANDLER: Ahhhh.

SUSIE: Uh, is your name Chandler?

CHANDLER: Uh, yes, yes it is.

SUSIE: Chandler Bing?

CHANDLER: Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?

SUSIE: I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal
crackers like a purse. 
CHANDLER: Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.

SUSIE: It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little
mirrors on it.

CHANDLER: Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.

SUSIE: Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw
my underpants.

CHANDLER: Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do
that anymore.

[cut to Monica and Rachel walking through the set]

MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

RACHEL: What what what what?

MONICA: Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.

RACHEL: Ya think?

MONICA: The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?

RACHEL: No, was he any good in it?

MONICA: Rachel, he like, totally changed time.

RACHEL: Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?

MONICA: Oh, yeah.

RACHEL: What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst
that could happen?

MONICA: He could hear me.

RACHEL: OK, I'm doin' it for ya.

MONICA: Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.

RACHEL: Excuse me. Hi.

VAN DAMME: Hi.

RACHEL: Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by
the way, um, she thinks you're cute.

VAN DAMME: You don't think I'm cute?

RACHEL: I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the
track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So
what should I tell her?

VAN DAMME: You can tell her I think her friend is cute.

[back to Chandler and Susie]

CHANDLER: No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was
the guy who had no elbows.

SUSIE: OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?

CHANDLER: OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.

[a voice in the background calls for makeup]

SUSIE: Oh that's me, I gotta go.

CHANDLER: Oh uh, o, OK.

SUSIE: Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you
ask me on a date.

CHANDLER: Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.

SUSIE: I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see
your underwear.

CHANDLER: No one was around to hear that?

[back to Rachel and Monica]

MONICA: So what'd he say?

RACHEL: Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean,
naturally, you know, I said no.

MONICA: Well, thanks anyway.

RACHEL: He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.

MONICA: Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to
me but if that's what you want to do...

RACHEL: Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey and the girls are sitting at the couches.]

RACHEL: And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

JOEY: Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.

RACHEL: Does anybody need anything?

MONICA: Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll
probably end up drinking it yourself.

RACHEL: That is so unfair.

PHOEBE: I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van
Damme.

[Ross enters]

ROSS: Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's
gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.

JOEY: You're blowin' me off for a monkey?

ROSS: Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.

JOEY: Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.

[Chandler enters]

CHANDLER: Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.

PHOEBE: Stick a fork what?

CHANDLER: Like, when you're cooking a steak.

PHOEBE: Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.

CHANDLER: Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?

PHOEBE: Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.

CHANDLER: OK, then, eat me, I'm done.

CHANDLER: I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling
around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an
elevator?'

MONICA: What did you say?

CHANDLER: Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know
what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?

PHOEBE: Oh, you just know.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Susie are making out on the couch.]

SUSIE: Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.

CHANDLER: Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take
more that 2, 3 minutes tops.

SUSIE: Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.

SUSIE: But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?

CHANDLER: Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three
of us in there.

SUSIE: Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at
dinner.

CHANDLER: You want me to wear your panties?

SUSIE: Could ya?

CHANDLER: Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . .
You're swell.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is setting up for his time with Marcel. Joey is there.]

ROSS: OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite
dish, banannacake.

JOEY: Oooh.

ROSS: With mealworms.

JOEY: Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?

[phone rings]

ROSS: Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a
monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special
planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Rachel are upset with each other.
Phoebe is mediating.]

PHOEBE: OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.

RACHEL: Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces
behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see
you in the TV set?

PHOEBE: Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...

MONICA: Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.

RACHEL: That is the most ridiculous.

MONICA: You sold me out.

RACHEL: I did not sell you out.

MONICA: Yes you did. Absolutely.

RACHEL: Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]

MONICA: Did you just flick me?

RACHEL: OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow.
That hurt [flicks Monica]

MONICA: Quit flicking [flicks]

RACHEL: Ow, you stop flicking.

MONICA: You flicked me first.

[They keep flicking each other. This turns into slapping each other. This leads to
wrestling on the floor. All the while Phoebe is saying "Happy thoughts".
Eventually Phoebe gets fed up.]

PHOEBE: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.

[Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear]

MONICA AND RACHEL: Ow. Ow. Ow.

PHOEBE: Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.

RACHEL: Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?

MONICA: Uh-huh.

RACHEL: You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead?
That's what you want?

MONICA: OK.

RACHEL: Oh that's what you want.

MONICA: Yes.

RACHEL: Fine.

MONICA: Fine,

PHOEBE: There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my
bitches.

[Scene: A fancy restraunt (Marcel's). Joey, Ross, Chandler, Susie, and the Director's
Assistant are there.]

ROSS: Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.

JOEY: Forget about it.

SUSIE: How you doin there squirmy?

CHANDLER: I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.

JOEY: So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a
ton of cool responsibilities.

DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: I have nothing to do with casting.

JOEY: So what're you guys gonna eat?

SUSIE: How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all
over?

CHANDLER: Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.

SUSIE: I want you right here, right now.

CHANDLER: Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa [Susie
grabs him under the table] They do have the shrimp.

SUSIE: Meet me in the bathroom. [she leaves for the bathroom]

CHANDLER: I'm going to the bathroom now. [leaves for the bathroom]

[In the bathroom Susie and Chandler are kissing. She backs into a stall.]

SUSIE: C'mon.

CHANDLER: I can't believe we're doing this.

SUSIE: Alright mister, let's see those panties.

CHANDLER: Alrighty. [we see Chandler's pants drop from under the stall door]

SUSIE: Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?

CHANDLER: What?

SUSIE: If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.

CHANDLER: Oh.

SUSIE: Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes
off.

CHANDLER: OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the
specials.

SUSIE: C'mon hurry, hurry.

CHANDLER: Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?

SUSIE: Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.

CHANDLER: OK.

[She turns him facing the toilet and sneaks out of the stall and gathers up his clothes.]

SUSIE: Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.

CHANDLER: Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.

SUSIE: This is for the fourth grade.

CHANDLER: Huh? Where, whaddya mean?

SUSIE: Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what
I mean.

CHANDLER: What, what's what you mean?

SUSIE: My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.

CHANDLER: That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?

SUSIE: Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about
this. [she leaves with his clothes]

CHANDLER: Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.

[Scene: Monica and Van Damme are walking down the street.]

MONICA: I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death,
now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? [he nods] Can you
beat up that guy?

VAN DAMME: Sure.

MONICA: This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to
go on a blind date.

VAN DAMME: Normally, I would not do it.

MONICA: Well, what made you make the exception for me?

VAN DAMME: 'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh,
Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...

[Scene: Back at Monica and Rachel's apartment. They are now fighting about what Rachel
told Van Damme.]

MONICA: Say you're sorry.

RACHEL: No. [hitting each other]

MONICA: Say it.

RACHEL: No. [hitting again]

[Monica grabs Rachel by the sweater. Rachel squirms out of it]

MONICA: Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.

RACHEL: OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.

MONICA: Say you're sorry.

RACHEL: OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. [She grabs a jar of tomato sauce
and Monica's purse]

MONICA: What're you gonna do?

RACHEL: You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.

MONICA: You don't have the guts.

RACHEL: Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was
cute.

[Monica pulls a thread on Rachel's sweater and Rachel dumps the tomato sauce in Monica's
purse]

PHOEBE: Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember
why this even started in the first place?

[Monica and Rachel start yelling at the same time]

PHOEBE: Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at
yourselves.

MONICA: I'll help you fix your sweater.

RACHEL: I'll help you throw out your purse.

MONICA: I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.

RACHEL: Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.

MONICA: I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves [pulls Rachel's gloves out of her purse]

[Scene: Back at the restroom at Marcel's. Chandler is still in the stall, Joey comes in
to go to the bathroom.]

[Joey starts whistling, Chandler finishes the tune. Joey whistles again.]

CHANDLER: Joey?

JOEY: Ma?

CHANDLER: Joey!

JOEY: Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.

CHANDLER: Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.

JOEY: Are you naked in there?

CHANDLER: Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.

JOEY: Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?

CHANDLER: No, no, this is the first time.

JOEY: Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone
walks off with your clothes.

CHANDLER: I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.

JOEY: Well, let me see.

CHANDLER: No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.

JOEY: Alright, alright. [climbs up in the next stall and looks over at Chandler] Woah,
someone's flossing.

[Ross enters, sees Joey in the mirror]

ROSS: [to Joey who's looking over a toilet stall] Joey, some people don't like that.

JOEY: Chandler's wearing panties.

ROSS: What? Let me see. [climbs up in the other adjoining stall]

CHANDLER: No, no, you don't have to see.

ROSS: Hi Tushie.

CHANDLER: Alright, one of you give me your underpants.

JOEY: Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.

CHANDLER: How can you not be wearing any underwear?

JOEY: Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.

CHANDLER: Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.

[Some guy has entered.]

ALL: Hi.

[Back at the table. Joey and Ross return. Shortly, Chandler comes out, holding the stall
door in front of him, and leaves.]

[Joey enters]

JOEY: Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.

ROSS: What happened?

JOEY: One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying
on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there
and say goodbye.

ROSS: Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff.
But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.

PHOEBE: [sees Marcel at the window] Oh my God.

ROSS: What?

["Looks Like We Made It" starts playing and we enter a whole sequence of Marcel
and Ross having fun in the city.]

[Scene: The movie set. Monica and Rachel are saying goodbye to Jean-Claude]

VAN DAMME: Goodbye.

MONICA: Well, bye for me too. [kisses him]

RACHEL: OK, well, bye-bye again. [kisses him again]

MONICA: OK.

VAN DAMME: Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .

MONICA AND RACHEL: Oh, no no no no no.

VAN DAMME: Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.

MONICA AND RACHEL: No no no no.

MONICA AND RACHEL: Bye-bye.

[Scene: City street. Whole gang is there seeing off Marcel.]

RACHEL: Oh yeah.

PHOEBE: Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I

weight, I'll be back on track.

OPENING TITLES 

[Scene: A kitchen somewhere. Monica is interviewing for a job]

INTERVIEWER: Well, this all looks good.

MONICA: Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.

INTERVIEWER: Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a

love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.

ROSS: [puts the message in the cupboard] I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I
mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm
takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be
takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we
should get some kind of me, message service.

PHOEBE: Hang in there, it's gonna happen.

 ROSS: Wha, OK, now how do you know that?

PHOEBE: Because she's your lobster.

CHANDLER: Oh, she's goin' somewhere.

PHOEBE: C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.
You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya
know, holding claws like. . .

[Monica enters from bathroom after taking a shower]

 CHANDLER: Hey, you feelin' better?

MONICA: Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.

 PHOEBE: So, do you have any other possibilities?

MONICA: Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.

ROSS: Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.

MONICA: No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.

ROSS: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You
feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.

CHANDLER: Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls
off]

 PHOEBE: What is that sparkly thing?

CHANDLER: That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica answers the door and lets her parents in.
They are carrying boxes.]

MONICA: Hi.

MR. GELLER: Hi.

MRS. GELLER: Hi darling.

MONICA: So, what's this.

MR. GELLER: Some of your old stuff.

MRS. GELLER: Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.

MONICA: Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?

MR. GELLER: Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and
plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.

MONICA: Oh, God forbid.

[Rachel enters with a laundry basket]

MRS. GELLER: Oh, hi Rachel.

RACHEL: Hi.

MRS. GELLER: Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.

RACHEL: Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.

MR. GELLER: Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy
ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.

RACHEL: What, what incident?

MR. GELLER: Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting on couches. A beautiful woman is
looking at Chandler.]

PHOEBE: Do you want a refill?

CHANDLER: No, I'm alright, thanks.

 PHOEBE: OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this
just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her
best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really
good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.

CHANDLER: [walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of
Wendy's.

GAIL: I'm Gail.

CHANDLER: Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]

GAIL: I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.

 CHANDLER: What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent.
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he
has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.

PHOEBE: It's not that bad.

CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some
reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]

PHOEBE: Chandler, Chandler.

 CHANDLER: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity
the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh,
impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without
saying anything] That's actually good.

[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is talking to a man at the counter. Ross and Phoebe are
sitting at the couches.]

ROSS: Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like,
back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.

PHOEBE: I think she's OK.

ROSS: [Rachel, laughing, puts a hand on the guy's shoulder] Look at that, look at that,
see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. [walks
up in the middle of their conversation] Excuse me, are you Rachel?

RACHEL: What?

ROSS: I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.

RACHEL: What are you, what are you doin'?

ROSS: Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if
it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.

MAN: Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.

ROSS: OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. [man leaves] You're welcome.

RACHEL: What?

ROSS: I was saving you.

RACHEL: Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man,
saving me?

ROSS: Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .

RACHEL: OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.

ROSS: But, you are.

RACHEL: What?

ROSS: Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.

RACHEL: OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?

ROSS: No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when
they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya

whole lobster thing?

PHOEBE: Do the claws again.

ROSS: Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?

RACHEL: Ross, there is no us, OK.

ROSS: No, but. . .

RACHEL: No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I
again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not
worth it.

ROSS: Well, but, but. . .

RACHEL: NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.

ROSS: E-except, except that what?

RACHEL: No, no, ACC-cept that.

ROSS: Oh.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is there. Joey enters.]

 CHANDLER: Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? [Joey doesn't
respond] Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say
uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? [Throws a basketball to Joey. Joey
doesn't move to catch it and the ball takes out a lamp] OK, that's my bad.

JOEY: If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.

CHANDLER: Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say
something about our friendship and how much it means to me?

 JOEY: Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and
you made fun of me?

CHANDLER: OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on
that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a
hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing
from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just
uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]

JOEY: You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]

 CHANDLER: I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as
a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may
haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Mr. and Mrs. Geller are watching tennis on TV,

ROSS: Hey guys.

MRS. GELLER: Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?

ROSS: No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.

MR. GELLER: A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.

MRS. GELLER: Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up. [the
Gellers return to watching TV and Ross goes over to Monica]

 MONICA: Where have you been?

ROSS: Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?

MONICA: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.

ROSS: C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.

 MONICA: Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you
this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.

MRS. GELLER: Why?

MONICA: Because they made me.

MRS. GELLER: You were fired? What're you gonna do?

MR. GELLER: Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught
her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?

MONICA and ROSS: In the bank.

MR. GELLER: There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's
gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. [pulls a quarter
from behind her ear]

MONICA: Anything larger back there?

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Phoebe enter.]

CHANDLER: I can't believe it.

 PHOEBE: Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play
in the hay.

CHANDLER: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just
dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
[sits down at the bar]

RACHEL: [comes up from behind the bar and startles Chandler] Hey. I've got something
that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? [holds up Chandler's bracelet]

PHOEBE: Hey now you have two. [Chandler looks annoyed] Oh, now you have two.

CHANDLER: What am I gonna do, huh? [Joey walks in behind him]

JOEY: Hey.

CHANDLER: Hey.

JOEY: How come you have two?

CHANDLER: Well this one's for you.

 JOEY: Get out.

CHANDLER: No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know
that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me
and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.

 JOEY: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're
bracelet buddies.

CHANDLER: That's what they'll call us.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Ross are standing in the kitchen.
Ross is filling out a check]

ROSS: Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.

MONICA: You have dinosaur checks?

ROSS: Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong
with that?

MONICA: Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you,
I'm very greatful.

PHOEBE: [Standing in living room with Chandler and Joey. She pulls a huge bathing suit out
of a box] Hey, Mon, what is this?

 MONICA: Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh,
a little bigger then.

CHANDLER: Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.

JOEY: [pulls out a VCR tape] Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?

MONICA: Hey, you got me, put it in.

ROSS: [Rachel enters] Oh.

RACHEL: Hi.

ROSS: Hi.

MRS. GELLER: Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she
look pretty. Jack, get this. [Rachel enters with a huge nose]

 RACHEL: Oh my God.

JOEY: What is with your nose?

RACHEL: They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.

CHANDLER: OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.

MONICA: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.

RACHEL: Oh.

ROSS: You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.

ALL: Oh yeah we do. C'mon.

MRS. GELLER: Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.

MONICA: Over here dad. [he pans over and we see a torso taking up the whole screen]

MR, GELLER: Wait, how do you zoom out? [zooms out and we see an extremely overweight
Monica eating a big sandwich] There she is.

 JOEY: Some girl ate Monica.

MONICA: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.

CHANDLER: Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?

MONICA: Oh, you look so great.

RACHEL: Ahh, so do you, beautiful. [they hug]

MONICA: Oops.

RACHEL: What?

MONICA: Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.

RACHEL: Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.

MR. GELLER: Everybody smile.

MONICA: Oh, dad, turn it off.

MR. GELLER: It is off.

MONICA: Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?

 MR. GELLER: It's the off light. Right Ross? [pans over to see Ross
with an afro and moustache]

JOEY: Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.

ROSS: You look pretty tonight.

RACHEL: Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?

ROSS: Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.

RACHEL: [the shoulders of her dress keep falling off her shoulders] Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down, I can't. . .

ROSS: Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . . [doorbell rings]

RACHEL: Oh, the guys are here.

ROSS: this summer?

RACHEL: Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.

MONICA: Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.

RACHEL: Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?

ROY: He'll be here OK, take a chill pill. [Chip pins Monica's corsage on, Monica then
turns and whispers to Rachel]

 MONICA: I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.

RACHEL: I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.

MONICA: If you're not going then I don't want to go either.

ROY: Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.

MRS. GELLER: [to Ross on the stairs] I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to
the prom.

ROSS: Doubtful.

MRS. GELLER: Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.

MR. GELLER: Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.

ROSS: Dad, she won't want to go with me.

MR. GELLER: Of course she would, you're a college man.

ROSS: I don't know.

MR. GELLER: Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?

RACHEL: I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.

ROSS: OK. Hold my board.

MR. GELLER: Atta boy. [Ross scrambles upstairs to change]

ROSS: OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.

MR. GELLER: Press the button.

MRS. GELLER: Which one? Which button, Jack.

MR. GELLER: The button, the button.

 MONICA: I can't believe you did that.

sympathetic head tilt. [demonstrating] 'How ya doin'? You OK?'

MONICA: I'm sorry.

DR. BURKE: No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm
OK' head bob. [demonstrates] 'I'm OK.' [tilts head] 'You sure?' [bobs head] 'Yeah, I'm
fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the

on Rachel's butt. Rachel starts laughing.]

ROSS: What, what.

RACHEL: I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my
butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.

ROSS: And that's, that's funny why?

RACHEL: Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya

CHANDLER: Waaa-aaah.

JOEY: What?

CHANDLER: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.

JOEY: Yeah, so.

CHANDLER: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my
toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?

JOEY: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.

CHANDLER: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.

JOEY: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?

CHANDLER: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.

JOEY: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the
first thing you wash.

OPENING TITLES

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are sitting at the table, Joey
and Chandler enter.]

CHANDLER: Hey.

MONICA and PHOEBE: Hey.

JOEY: Hey.

PHOEBE: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?

JOEY: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.

PHOEBE: Ahh.

RACHEL: [enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.

PHOEBE: Okey-doke.

MONICA: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.

CHANDLER: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?

RACHEL: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.

JOEY: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?

PHOEBE: Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.

CHANDLER: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

JOEY: So where you gettin' it?

PHOEBE: I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]

ROSS: What? What's on your shoulder?

PHOEBE: Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.

ROSS: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.

RACHEL: Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?

ROSS: No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair
cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?

MONICA: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.

CHANDLER: Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?

MONICA: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.

JOEY: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?

MONICA: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.

PHOEBE: No, I think you should tell them.

MONICA: No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them
anything.

ROSS: I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and
Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'

[Scene: The Gellers' house. Monica, Ross, and Richard are arriving to Mr. Gellers
birthday party.]

ROSS: Alright, shall we?

MONICA: OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You
get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something
up.

ROSS: Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
[opens door] We're here.

MRS. GELLER: Oh hi kids. Hi darling.

MONICA: Happy birthday dad.

MR. GELLER: Oh thank you.

ROSS: Hi ma.

RICHARD: Happy birthday.

MRS. GELLER: Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?

ROSS: Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.

[Scene: The Gellers' kitchen. Monica, Mrs. Geller and one of Mrs. Geller's friends are
preparing the cake.]

FRIEND: Well, you kids take the train in?

MRS. GELLER: No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

FRIEND: Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
[Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]

MONICA: Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.

MRS. GELLER: Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.

MONICA: Are we still on that?

MRS. GELLER: We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.

FRIEND: She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still
pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]

[Scene: Joey's co-star's apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.]

JOEY: Can you believe this place?

CHANDLER: I know, this is a great apartment.

JOEY: Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when
you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.

CHANDLER: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.

JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.

JOEY: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.

JOEY'S CO-STAR: Thanks. You want it?

JOEY: Huh?

JOEY'S CO-STAR: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.

JOEY: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?

JOEY'S CO-STAR: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the
kitchen.

CHANDLER: [being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning -
on TV. Stop talking. OK.

[Scene: Mr. Geller's party. Mr. Geller and a friend are questioning Richard while Ross
observes.]

MR. GELLER: C'mon, tell us.

FRIEND: Yeah, is she really 20.

RICHARD: I am not telling you guys anything.

MR. GELLER: C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.

ROSS: Dad, you really don't want to do that.

MR. GELLER: Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?

RICHARD: Jack, would you let it go?

MR. GELLER: Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche.
You... you got your own little speedster.

RICHARD: Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.

MR. GELLER: Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. .
.

ROSS: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.

MR. GELLER: What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.

[Scene: Tattoo parlor. Phoebe and Rachel are deciding on tattoos.]

PHOEBE: OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?

RACHEL: Well I. . .

PHOEBE: I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more
open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.

TATTOO ARTIST: Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with
me.

PHOEBE: Here we go.

RACHEL: [reluctantly] Uh-huh.

PHOEBE: You're not going?

RACHEL: Uh-huh.

PHOEBE: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?

RACHEL: No. Well, yeah, maybe.

PHOEBE: I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals
boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?

RACHEL: What's 1922?

PHOEBE: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a
lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you
want to get this tattoo?

RACHEL: Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .

PHOEBE: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

RACHEL: No.

PHOEBE: OK, who is the boss of you?!!

RACHEL: You?

PHOEBE: No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart
tattooed on your hip. GO!!

[Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.]

RICHARD: How ya doin'?

MONICA: I'm a twinkie.

RICHARD: Really? I'm a hero.

MONICA: Oh, this is so hard.

RICHARD: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.

MONICA: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.

RICHARD: My parents are dead.

MONICA: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.

RICHARD: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.

MONICA: Alright.

RICHARD: [walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the
bathroom] Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.

MRS. GELLER: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.

[Monica jumps in the shower. Right after Mrs. Geller enters the bathroom, Mr. Geller peeks
his head in.]

MR. GELLER: Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I
have one.

MRS. GELLER: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?

MR. GELLER: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.

MRS. GELLER: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.

MR. GELLER: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told
Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.

MRS. GELLER: Really.

MR. GELLER: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.

MRS. GELLER: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?

MR. GELLER: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.

MRS. GELLER: [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.

MR. GELLER: C'mon, it's my birthday.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are returning from their
brunch.]

JOEY: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.

CHANDLER: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.

JOEY: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.

CHANDLER: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.

JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.

CHANDLER: What?

JOEY: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place
where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.

CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here
by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.

JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live
together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.

CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.

JOEY: Well that's how I feel.

CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it.

JOEY: Well then maybe I will.

CHANDLER: Fine with me.

JOEY: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the
spoons.

[Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Mr. and Mrs. Geller enter looking particularly
refreshed. Monica follows looking rather pale.]

MR. GELLER: Who's drink can I freshen?

MRS. GELLER: Almost time for cake.

ROSS: Mon, Mon, are you OK?

MONICA: You remember that video I found of mom and dad?

ROSS: Yeah.

MONICA: Well, I just caught the live show.

ROSS: Eww.

[Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica and Richard are alone in the kitchen.]

MONICA: Hey there.

RICHARD: What?

MONICA: Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.

RICHARD: Humm, really?

[Mrs. Geller and Ross both enter]

MRS. GELLER: Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?

RICHARD: Uhh, not that I know of.

MRS. GELLER: Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?

RICHARD: That - that's an idea.

MONICA: Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.

MRS. GELLER: Oh?

RICHARD: Oh?

ROSS: Ohh.

MRS. GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?

ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of
them aren't. Is that crystal?

MRS. GELLER: So, who's the mystery man?

MONICA: Well, uh, he's a doctor.

MRS. GELLER: A real doctor?

MONICA: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's
sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]

MRS. GELLER: Well that's wonderful. . . I

MONICA: Mom, it's OK.

RICHARD: It is Judy.

MRS. GELLER: Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!

MR. GELLER: [enters with his bat] Found it.

ROSS: I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]

MRS. GELLER: It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.

MR. GELLER: That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.

MONICA: Dad, I'm the twinkie.

MR. GELLER: You're the twinkie?

RICHARD: She's not a twinkie.

MONICA: Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .

MRS. GELLER: Oh please, a relationship.

MONICA: Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.

RICHARD: Really?

MONICA: Yes.

MR. GELLER: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?

MONICA: Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've
never seen Richard happier.

MR. GELLER: When did I say that?

MONICA: Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.

[Everyone else enters and all start singing Happy Birthday.]

[Scene: Tattoo parlor. Rachel is showing Phoebe her tattoo.]

PHOEBE: Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.

RACHEL: I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.

PHOEBE: Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.

RACHEL: Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.

PHOEBE: Oh OK. [pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder] Oh no, oh it's gone,
that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.

RACHEL: You didn't get it?

PHOEBE: No.

RACHEL: Why didn't you get it?

PHOEBE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

RACHEL: Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.

PHOEBE: I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and
uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?

RACHEL: Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is at the bar and Joey enters.]

JOEY: No, we're alright.

CHANDLER: So I got ya something. [tosses Joey a bag of plastic spoons]

JOEY: Plastic spoons. Great.

CHANDLER: Lick away my man.

JOEY: These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.

CHANDLER: What?

JOEY: Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the
environment.

CHANDLER: No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?

JOEY: I'm movin' out like we talked about.

CHANDLER: Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought
that was just a fight.

JOEY: Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived
alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . .
whatever.

CHANDLER: Well, there you go.

JOEY: Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.

CHANDLER: Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh,
bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.

JOEY: Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?

CHANDLER: I did pay for half of it.

JOEY: Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.

CHANDLER: Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.

JOEY: Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.

CHANDLER: Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.

JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are setting the table.]

MONICA: So, are you sorry that I told them?

MONICA: Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.

RACHEL: Is Ross here?

MONICA: No he went out to get pizza.

RACHEL: Oh really, OK. [shows Monica her tattoo]

MONICA: That's great.

RICHARD: Very tasteful.

PHOEBE: Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?

MONICA: Yes.

RACHEL: What? You didn't get one.

PHOEBE: OK, well then what is this? [shows her bare shoulder]

RICHARD: What're we looking at? That blue freckle?

PHOEBE: OK, that's my tattoo.

RACHEL: That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair,
bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.

PHOEBE: OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of
the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.

RACHEL: Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where
the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she
bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]

ROSS: You got a tattoo?

RACHEL: Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.

ROSS: Lemme see. [looks]

RACHEL: Well?

ROSS: Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.

CHANDLER: Congratulations. [Chandler leaves]

[Scene: Chandler's apartment. The whole gang is helping Joey pack.]

JOEY: Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?

CHANDLER: Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler
gives him a look] except when we are here.

PHOEBE: I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.

MONICA: I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.

RACHEL: Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my
bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?

JOEY: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling
water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get
theirs accross the street.

CHANDLER: [quietly] Yeah, I remember.

ROSS: Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.

[Everyone except Joey and Chandler leave.]

CHANDLER: So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?

JOEY: Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.

CHANDLER: Thanks.

JOEY: So, I guess this is it.

CHANDLER: Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.

[Joey walks to the door. He stops, turns around.]


JOEY: Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.

CHANDLER: Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.

JOEY: Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.

CHANDLER: Yeah.

[Joey walks out and after a few seconds comes back in and gives Chandler a big hug. He
then leaves for good and Chandler is left alone in his apartment.]

JOEY: Art.

MONICA: Art it is.

ROSS: [looking at a glass table with a panther shaped base] Look, check this out. Is it a
coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.

RACHEL: [holding a pillow made out of 4 inch red fur] Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is

the last piece.

RACHEL: What's goin' on?

MONICA: Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like
I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's
here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .

RACHEL: Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.

[Joey's apartment, phone rings]

JOEY: Hello.

CHANDLER: Hey.

JOEY: Hey!

CHANDLER: That's right my friend. It's time for...

BOTH: Baywatch!! [both turn on TV's]

JOEY: Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?

CHANDLER: I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.

JOEY: Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.

CHANDLER: Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?

JOEY: Hey, hey, they're runnin'

CHANDLER: See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the
time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is sitting between Monica and Phoebe.]

MONICA: But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.

JOEY: I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts
but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.

PHOEBE: Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?

JOEY: You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but,
when I moved out, I hurt him bad.

MONICA: I promise you, he would definitely want you back.

[Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler is sitting between Rachel and Ross.]

ROSS: I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.

CHANDLER: But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it
was like when we first started living together.

ROSS: Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new
place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.

RACHEL: Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.

CHANDLER: But...

ROSS: No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK,
you're not... rommmates anymore.

[back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault]
OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat
acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

PRODUCER: Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a
hundred dollars a minute to be in here.

PHOEBE: Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Ross is on the phone.]

ROSS: No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK.
If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes
out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?

MONICA: I was.

ROSS: Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. [gets the other line]
Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. [hangs up the other
line] Call Joanna. [back on with Tony] Hi.

MONICA: Did she leave a number?

ROSS: Did you see me write one down?

MONICA: I don't have her number, butt-munch.

ROSS: Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.

MONICA: I'm not a baby, you're the baby.

ROSS: Look, you wanna get off my back?

MONICA: You wanna get out of my face?

ROSS: Wait hold on Tony, hold on. [answers second line] Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right

ROSS: OK.

MONICA: Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
[she starts throwing oranges at Ross who's looking pleased with himself]

[Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler is sitting on the bar, bouncing a ball against
the door. Joey walks in right as he throws the ball and catches it.]

JOEY: Hey.

CHANDLER: So uhh, how's the palace?

JOEY: You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the
boxes?

CHANDLER: Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.

EDDIE: Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just

CHANDLER: Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.

EDDIE: Nice to meet ya.

JOEY: Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. [grabs moose hat] It's what I came for. So, this is

EDDIE: At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a
chorizo.

JOEY: Wow.

CHANDLER: Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a
spare room.

JOEY: Oh, now it's a spare room?

CHANDLER: Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.

JOEY: Well I uh, got what I came for. [puts on moose hat] I'll uh, I'll see you guys.

EDDIE: [annoying laugh] Is this guy great or what?

JOEY: Yeah, yeah he is. [leaves]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Rachel, and Ross are there.]

MONICA: I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?

ROSS: Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.

RACHEL: It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.

[Pheobe enters]

PHOEBE: Hey.

ALL: Hey.

PHOEBE: Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.

ALL: [cheer]

PHOEBE: Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you
ever made a video. [puts the tape in] OK.

[The video is a very dramatic episode with an obviously dubbed voice for Phoebe. Everyone
watches in disbeliefe]

PHOEBE: Oh my God.

ROSS: I know.

PHOEBE: I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my
own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.

RACHEL: Pretty uhm, different huh?

PHOEBE: Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.

[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment. Joey stops by. Chandler is reading the paper
and Eddie is fixing eggs.]

EDDIE: Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?

JOEY: Eddie.

CHANDLER: Morning.

JOEY: Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. [looks for the mail on the table by
the door, it's not there] Where's the mail?

CHANDLER: Oh it's uh, over there on the table.

JOEY: You don't keep it over here on this table any more?

CHANDLER: No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.

EDDIE: Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?

CHANDLER: Oh, ooh.

JOEY: Huh.

CHANDLER: What?

JOEY: No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the
middle, a-la me.

CHANDLER: Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.

EDDIE: Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.

CHANDLER: See ya. [Eddie leaves]

JOEY: So how you two gettin' along?

CHANDLER: Oh, I couldn't be happier.

JOEY: Great, well, I'm happy for ya. [picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty]
Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the
mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the
people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.

CHANDLER: There's another carton right over there.

JOEY: Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.

CHANDLER: Alright, so what's it about?

JOEY: Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?

CHANDLER: Well I like both eggs equally.

JOEY: Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better
than the other and I wanna know which.

CHANDLER: Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took
your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross and Monica are fighting over the remote.]

MONICA: I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

ROSS: Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.

RACHEL: Would you guys stop.

MONICA: It's my TV.

ROSS: Wha-, oh, quit it.

MONICA: Bite me.

RACHEL: Oh my God.

ROSS: Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.

MONICA: Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.

RACHEL: Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this
like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot
bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. [goes in the bathroom]

MONICA: OK, what're we gonna do about this?

ROSS: Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.

MONICA: Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin-
you been here.

ROSS: Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.

MONICA: I just can't stand you being here all the time.

ROSS: Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're
just havin' fun.

MONICA: Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?

ROSS: Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like
when, uh, when we were kids.

MONICA: Ross, I hated you when we were kids.

ROSS: You hated me when we were kids?

MONICA: Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to'
kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.

ROSS: Why did you hate me?

MONICA: Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got
your way.

ROSS: And that wasn't fun for you?

MONICA: Duh-huh!

ROSS: I can't believe you hated me.

MONICA: Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.

ROSS: Really?

MONICA: Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.

ROSS: I can do that.

MONICA: Then I won't have to kill you.

ROSS: So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?

MONICA: Yeah, thanks. You know what?

ROSS: What?

MONICA: If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.

ROSS: Ohh... OK. [changes the channel]

[Scene: Central Perk. Ross, Rachel, and Monica are hanging out.]

[Phoebe enters]

PHOEBE: Hey.

ALL: Hey.

PHOEBE: Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the
video.

ALL: No.

PHOEBE: Yes.

RACHEL: Well, how did you find out?

PHOEBE: Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying
that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.

MONICA: So what're you gonna do?

PHOEBE: Well, I can't work with people who would do this.

MONICA: Sure.

PHOEBE: I mean this poor woman.

ROSS: What woman?

PHOEBE: The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a
video.

RACHEL: OK, Phoebs. But what about you?

PHOEBE: Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's
so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the
right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at
the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like
some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh,
oh that song has so many levels.

[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]

CHANDLER: Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?

EDDIE: No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.

CHANDLER: [stares in disbeliefe] Yeah o-, OK, alright. [oven timer goes off] Doesn't
matter, time for Baywatch.

EDDIE: Y-, y-, you like that show?

CHANDLER: You don't like that show?

EDDIE: Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the
beach, ya know.

CHANDLER: Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.

EDDIE: I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.

CHANDLER: Oh o-, OK man.

[Joey's place. He's watching Baywatch, lauging. He goes to say something to Chandler in
the other chair but no one's there. He goes to call Chandler but decides not to.]

[Chandler's. He's playing foosball by himself.]

[Joey's. Playing ping pong by himself.]

[All by myself is playing. Chandler is sitting in front of a window while it's
raining outside. We see Joey through a rainy window. The camera zooms out to show it's
just his tabletop water sculpture.]

CLOSING CREDITS 

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe is performing Smelly Cat.]

PHOEBE: [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.

ALL: Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.

PHOEBE: Monica.

MONICA: [sings] They won't take you to the vet.

PHOEBE: Chandler.

CHANDLER: [reluctantly sings] You're obviously not their favorite pet.

MONICA: Joey.

JOEY: [sings] It may not be a bed of roses.

PHOEBE: Rachel.

RACHEL: [sings] And you're no friend to those with noses.

PHOEBE: Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
END[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone except Ross is there
watching Days of Our Lives.]

AMBER: Oh Drake.

DR. REMORE: I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.

[Ross enters]

ROSS: I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?

MONICA: We, we just wanna see the end.

AMBER: I want you Drake.

DR. REMORE: I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.

AMBER: What?

DR. REMORE: There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.

[Everyone gasps. The show ends.]

RACHEL: So what happens next?

 JOEY: Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese
twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's
where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.

CHANDLER: God that is good TV.

OPENING TITLES

[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment. Chandler is at the foosball table trying to get
Phoebe to play a game with him.]

 CHANDLER: Phoebs, play with meeee.

PHOEBE: No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel
bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.

 CHANDLER: Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're
done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.

PHOEBE: Why don't you play with your roommate?

CHANDLER: Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.

PHOEBE: Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?

CHANDLER: No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.

PHOEBE: Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy
that, shall we?

CHANDLER: We don't need to remedy that.

PHOEBE: Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]

EDDIE: What was that?

 PHOEBE: Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of
us had some beers and got to know each other.

EDDIE: Yeah alright, that sounds alright.

PHOEBE: Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.

CHANDLER: That was so lame.

PHOEBE: I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]

CHANDLER: So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?

[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment. Chandler and Eddie are talking.]

EDDIE: That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?

 CHANDLER: What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually
thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.

EDDIE: That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...

CHANDLER: Well it's not Sean Penn.

 EDDIE: Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My
last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes,
there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she
says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it
was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all
over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm
falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. [finishes laughing] That
uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe is singing. Monica, Richard, Ross, and Rachel are
listening.]

 PHOEBE: And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest
of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.

RICHARD: Phoebe's got another job, right?

 RACHEL: Great set tonight Phoebs.

PHOEBE: I know.

ROSS: Well, we should probably get going.

RICHARD: Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.

 MONICA: Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your
apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.

RICHARD: I don't know, I don't have my jammies.

MONICA: Well, maybe you don't need them.

ROSS: My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

MONICA: Shut up, I'm happy.

PHOEBE: Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all
the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.

RICHARD: Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.

PHOEBE: Ok.

 RICHARD: Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been
a lot.

MONICA: Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.

RACHEL: Phoebe's dead.

[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment. Chandler is there. There's a knock at the door.
He answers it to see a young woman holding a fishtank.]

TILLY: Hi.

CHANDLER: Hi.

 TILLY: I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.

CHANDLER: Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or
a fishtank?

TILLY: Thanks.

CHANDLER: Oh, oh, c'mon in.

 TILLY: I'm Tilly.

CHANDLER: Oh.

TILLY: I gather by that oh that he told you about me.

CHANDLER: Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my
very soul.

 TILLY: He's kind of intense huh?

CHANDLER: Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...

EDDIE: [walks around corner] A little what?

CHANDLER: Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.

EDDIE: Hello Tilly.

TILLY: Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.

EDDIE: That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.

TILLY: Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.

EDDIE: Bye-bye.

CHANDLER: Bye.

[Tilly leaves]

CHANDLER: So, we gettin' a fish?

EDDIE: You had sex with her didn't you?

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey enters with several magazines and runs up to Phoebe.]

JOEY: Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.

PHOEBE: Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.

JOEY: Page 42, page 42, page 42.

PHOEBE: Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.'
Ooh, cool picture.

JOEY: Ooh, I look good.

 PHOEBE: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?

JOEY: Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well
the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to
die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'

PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are
gonna be kinda mad when they read this?

JOEY: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my
house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which
makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?

[Scene: At a writer's desk. The writer is working on a script for Days of Our Lives.]

WRITER: Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.

[Scene: Joey's apartment. The next script is being delivered.]

JOEY: I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator
shaft?

DELIVERY GUY: Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.

JOEY: They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.

 DELIVERY GUY: Right. Could you sign this?

JOEY: No. No way, I'm not signing that.

DELIVERY GUY: I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.

JOEY: How can they do this to me?

DELIVERY GUY: Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Richard, Ross, and Rachel are
returning.]

 MONICA: Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how
many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.

RACHEL: Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.

ROSS: G'night.

RICHARD: Night Richard. Good luck Mon.

 MONICA: Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how
many women you've been with.

RICHARD: Two.

MONICA: Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?

RICHARD: Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my
high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.

MONICA: Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]

 RICHARD: Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh
c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.

MONICA: Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.

[Rachel's bedroom]

RACHEL: Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.

ROSS: Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?

RACHEL: Uhhhooo.

 ROSS: C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.

 RACHEL: Well, there's you.

ROSS: Better not be doin' these in order.

RACHEL: Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.

ROSS: Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.

RACHEL: Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I
ever was with him.

ROSS: Really?

 RACHEL: Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All
it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo
much better in my head.

[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]

CHANDLER: Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.

EDDIE: That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with
her would say.

CHANDLER: This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a
fish tank, and left, end of story.

EDDIE: Where's Buddy?

CHANDLER: Buddy?

EDDIE: My fish, Buddy.

CHANDLER: There was no fish when she dropped it off.

EDDIE: Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend
then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?

 CHANDLER: Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand
on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're
just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up
the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are in Monica's bedroom.]

RICHARD: That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?

MONICA: Well yeah.

RICHARD: Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.

MONICA: You really ok with it?

RICHARD: Oh honey, I'm fine.

MONICA: Oh, yay. Ok about that two.

RICHARD: What? Alright, what about my two?

MONICA: Well, it just seems like a really small number.

RICHARD: Right, and...

MONICA: And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing
with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?

RICHARD: Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat
guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.

MONICA: But you've only slept with two people.

RICHARD: Right.

MONICA: Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.

RICHARD: Now I do. [they kiss and fall to the bed]

[Ross and Rachel are in Rachel's bedroom]

 RACHEL: Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much
better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me
laugh.

ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and
have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock
jokes.

RACHEL: God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...

 ROSS: Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're
saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like,
uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?

RACHEL: Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good
with Paolo.

ROSS: Knock-knock.

RACHEL: But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have
intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.

ROSS: Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed]

[later in the bathroom Monica is looking in the drawer, Rachel runs up]

RACHEL: Oh, hi.

MONICA: Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.

RACHEL: Oh my God, honey that's great.

MONICA: I know. I just can't find...

RACHEL: Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.

MONICA: You need one too?

RACHEL: Ooooh yeah.

[they pull out the box of condoms but there's only one left]

MONICA: There's only one.

RICHARD: Monica.

MONICA: Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. [shuts the
bathroom door]

ROSS: [comes out of the bedroom] Rachel. [growls then sees Richard standing there] Hey.

RICHARD: Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.

ROSS: Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?

RICHARD: No.

ROSS: Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?

RICHARD: I have a little comb.

ROSS: Oh. And what do you call that?

RICHARD: A moustache comb.

 RACHEL: Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.

MONICA: No.

RACHEL: Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.

MONICA: Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we
keep the dustpan.

RACHEL: Agghhh.

ROSS: So were you in Nam?

RACHEL: Rock-paper-scissors?

MONICA: Yeah.

RACHEL and MONICA: One two three. [Rachel picks rock, Monica picks scissors]

RACHEL: Yeesss.

MONICA: Fine, go have sex.

RICHARD: No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John
Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.

ROSS: No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...

RACHEL: Honey.

ROSS: What, what oh....[Ross and Rachel go into her room]

RICHARD: Shall we?

 MONICA: It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do
it tomorrow.

RICHARD: Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. All but Joey are present.]

CHANDLER: So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.

MONICA: Why?

CHANDLER: Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

 PHOEBE: Why would you kill his fish?

CHANDLER: Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the
fish.

RACHEL: Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? [they turn on
the TV]

ROSS: Yeah.

MONICA: Wait, he's not here yet.

RACHEL: So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.

ROSS: Yeah.

MONICA: Alright.

CHANDLER: Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.

RACHEL: Oh good.

DR. REMORE: Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend
and as your brother.

AMBER: Oh Drake.

DR HORTON: Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.

DR. REMORE: Some guys are just lucky I guess.

INTERCOM: Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.

DR. REMORE: Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?

DR. HORTON: No, no, they only said you.

DR. REMORE: Oh, ok. Alright.

AMGER: I love you Drake.

DR. REMORE: Yeah, whatever. Oh no.

AMBER: Drake, look out.

DR. REMORE: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

 MONICA: Did they just kill off Joey?

ROSS: No. [sound of Dr. Remore's body hitting the bottom of the shaft] Now maybe.

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Everyone is outside knocking.]

ROSS: C'mon.

RACHEL: Joey.

ROSS: Open up. We want to talk to you.

JOEY: I don't feel like talkin.

RACHEL: Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.

CHANDLER: We're worried about you.

MONICA: And some of us really have to pee.

[Joey opens the door]

MONICA: Sorry Joey [runs to the bathroom]

JOEY: Hey.

PHOEBE: Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.

CHANDLER: We came over as soon as we saw.

ROSS: How could you not tell us?

JOEY: I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.

RACHEL: Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.

 JOEY: Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so
smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind
of irony or somethin.

 PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it
was just a dumb soap opera.

JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

PHOEBE: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have
something nice to say.

MONICA: Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me
that's nice.

CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that?

JOEY: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you
think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But
this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card
application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my
life.

CHANDLER: I'm sorry man.

 RACHEL: Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to
you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.

JOEY: No, that means nothin to me.

[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.Chandler walks in to see Eddie holding a tray of
cookies.]

CHANDLER: Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?

CHANDLER: [throws it across the room while Eddie's not looking] Listen Eddie, um, I've
been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?

 EDDIE: I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named
him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.

CHANDLER: [looks in the fish bowl to see a fish cracker] Well that's not an, even a real

EDDIE: What's you point man?

CHANDLER: Ok, good night. [walks towards his room] You big freak of nature.

hat.]

JOEY: Hey.

MONICA: Hey.

 RACHEL: Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine
workin' huh?

 JOEY: Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th
avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?

MONICA: A mirror?

JOEY: Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

MONICA: Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.

JOEY: Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr.
Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of
cache.

 MONICA: Cache? Jaunty?

JOEY: Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.

[Phoebe enters]

PHOEBE: Hey.

MONICA: Hey.

RACHEL: Hey.

PHOEBE: Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?

MONICA: Oh my God, it was incredible.

PHOEBE: Didn't it like totally speak to you?

RACHEL: Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?

MONICA: Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's
about how women need to become more empowered.

PHOEBE: Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But
you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.

RACHEL: Men just take out wind?

PHOEBE: Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.

RACHEL: Wow.

PHOEBE: Yeah.

RACHEL: Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.

MONICA: It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've
ever had, except for Richard.

 PHOEBE: Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.

MONICA: No.

PHOEBE: No, 'cause he's yummy.

MONICA: Yes. But all the other ones.

PHOEBE: Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of
inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.

JOEY: Anybody want a croan.

 PHOEBE: Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there,
it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'

[Scene: Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.Joey is there.]

ESTELLE: Don't worry about it already. Things happen.

JOEY: So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?

ESTELLE: Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

JOEY: No, can we get back to me?

ESTELLE: Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you
an audition for Another World.

JOEY: Alright. Cab driver number two?

ESTELLE: You're welcome.

JOEY: But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a
cab?

ESTELLE: Things change, roll with em.

JOEY: But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do
this.

ESTELLE: Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs.
Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.

JOEY: I'm sorry. See ya.

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Rachel has just finished
reading the book.]

RACHEL: Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.

MONICA: Isn't it.

 RACHEL: Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean
this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.

PHOEBE: I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice
gift for you.

ROSS: Hey you guys.

MONICA: Hey.

ROSS: Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.

RACHEL: NO!

ROSS: No?

 RACHEL: No, why do we always have to do everything according to your
time table?

ROSS: Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the
beginning.

RACHEL: No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.

 MONICA: You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?

ROSS: Excuse me, your, your, your wind?

 RACHEL: Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let
me blow?

ROSS: You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.

RACHEL: Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.

PHOEBE: Um-um, um-um.

RACHEL: You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey and Ross enter.]

JOEY: What is it?

 ROSS: I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees
and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's
pretty upset about it.

JOEY: See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.

 ROSS: What, what's that?

JOEY: It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.

ROSS: Open it, open in.

JOEY: Oh my God.

ROSS: Woah.

JOEY: Look at this, how did I spend so much money?

ROSS: Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.

JOEY: Ahh.

 ROSS: What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?

JOEY: My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all
confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

ROSS: Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.

JOEY: What?

ROSS: That audition.

JOEY: That's a two line part.

 ROSS: Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.

JOEY: So what.

ROSS: So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.

JOEY: Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.

ROSS: Toilet paper?

JOEY: Yeah.

ROSS: Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.

JOEY: Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.

ROSS: I am your friend.

 JOEY: Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and,
'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'

ROSS: But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.

JOEY: Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.

ROSS: Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who
knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.

JOEY: Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.

ROSS: Huh, I'm just saying...

JOEY: Well don't just say.

ROSS: Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.

JOEY: Ok.

ROSS: Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.

JOEY: I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things
are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?

[Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler peeks in the door. He doesn't see Eddie so he
enters, breathing a sigh of relief. Eddie pops up from behind the bar.]

EDDIE: Hey pal.

CHANDLER: Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?

EDDIE: Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this
thing's fantastic!

CHANDLER: Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?

 EDDIE: Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a
lot fiestier that the last one.

CHANDLER: Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there
something else you're supposed to be doing right now?

EDDIE: Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

CHANDLER: Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the
time...

 EDDIE: Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?

CHANDLER: Your last roommate's kidney?

EDDIE: That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey goes up to the bar to order.]

JOEY: Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.

GUNTHER: Lemonade? You ok man?

JOEY: Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on
the show.

GUNTHER: Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?

JOEY: I fell down an elevator shaft.

GUNTHER: That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.

JOEY: What?

GUNTHER: I used to be Bryce on All My Children.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler is sleeping on the couch. Monica walks

[Chandler wakes up]

 CHANDLER: Daaahhhh!

MONICA: Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!

more watching.

MONICA: I wa-

CHANDLER: Uuuh.

[Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler is returning from Monica and Rachel's with his
bedding. Eddie is standing at the bar with his dehydrator and loads of fruit.]

 EDDIE: Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate
here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what
happens with these water balloons.

CHANDLER: Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

EDDIE: What?

 CHANDLER: You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit
and GET OUT!

EDDIE: You, you want, you want me to move out?

CHANDLER: Uh-huh.

EDDIE: I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean
don't you think?

CHANDLER: This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.

EDDIE: Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright,
alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. [walks out the door and after a pause comes back
in] But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane
Jack!

CHANDLER: You want some help.

EDDIE: No help required Chico. [reaches into the tank and grabs the fish and puts it in
his pocket]

[Scene: Joey is at the cab driver interview.]

JOEY: All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost
you about so bucks.

CASTING GUY: Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.

JOEY: What?

CASTING GUY: Five oh dollars.

JOEY: Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days
of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and
everything. 

CASTING GUY: That's great.

 JOEY: And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene
like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a
background in medical acting.

 CASTING GUY: Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.

JOEY: No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could
take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You
were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. [gets up and
leaves]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around
the coffee table.]

 PHOEBE: Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning
bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.

MONICA: And I would have to say pah-huh.

PHOEBE: What?

MONICA: Do you not remember the puppet guy?

RACHEL: Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.

MONICA: And his puppet too.

 PHOEBE: Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest
of my righteous truth on the first date.

MONICA: Who?

PHOEBE: Paul.

MONICA: Oh.

 RACHEL: Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number
29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.

MONICA: Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.

RACHEL: Not uh, not to my recollection.

MONICA: Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was
totally pointing at me.

RACHEL: Only 'cause you took up half the circle.

 PHOEBE: Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be
going to the goddess meetings alone.

RACHEL: Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up
with Monica.

MONICA: One hour? You are such a leaf blower.

[Monica goes into her room and slams the door. Rachel does the same. Phoebe, without a
door to slam, opens a small chest and slams the lid.]

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is watching movers take all his stuff away.]

JOEY: Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.

ROSS: [enters] Oh my God, what's goin' on?

JOEY: They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.

 ROSS: No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you.
I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole
security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you,
you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.

JOEY: Thanks Ross.

ROSS: Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much
respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.

JOEY: I went.

ROSS: Great, how did it go?

JOEY: I didn't get it.

ROSS: Good for you.

JOEY: What?

ROSS: You're livin' the dream.

JOEY: Huh?

ROSS: All right then.

JOEY: [movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.

ROSS: What?

JOEY: I can't watch this.

ROSS: [approaching the mover holding the parrot] Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the
uh, how much to save the bird?

MOVER: 1200.

 ROSS: Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?

JOEY: Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.

ROSS: Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?

MOVER: Uh, the dog. [points to a big poecelain greyhound]

ROSS: Huh.

MOVER: Yeah.

ROSS: I'll take it. My gift to you man.

JOEY: Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Phoebe are sitting ignoring each other. Rachel walks
up with two pieces of cake.]

RACHEL: Here are your cakes.

MONICA: We didn't order cake.

RACHEL: No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough
trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.

MONICA: You're right.

RACHEL: You know.

PHOEBE: I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.

RACHEL: Thank you. So are we good?

MONICA: We're good.

RACHEL: We're good?

PHOEBE: Yeah.

 RACHEL: Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take
that out of my paycheck.

 CHANDLER: [enters] Ding dong, the psycho's gone.

MONICA: Are you sure this time?

 CHANDLER: Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is
standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN
HEAD!

 EDDIE: [enters] Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in
the alley behind Macy's.

MONICA: There is no alley behind Macy's.

EDDIE: So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's
gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?

CHANDLER: Our next cocktail party?

EDDIE: Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.

CHANDLER: Eddie, do you remember yesterday?

EDDIE: Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

CHANDLER: Do you remember talking to me yesterday?

EDDIE: Uh, yes.

 CHANDLER: So what happened?

EDDIE: We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.

CHANDLER: Oh sweet Moses.

MONICA: So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?

EDDIE: Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?

CHANDLER: Well, I'm, I'm sorry...[Eddie forces his head in the door] Ahhh. Have we met?

EDDIE: It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.

CHANDLER: I, I'm sorry, I uh [unchains the door and opens it all the way] I already have a
roommate. [Joey turns around in the leather recliner]

JOEY: Hello.

CHANDLER: Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about
man.

EDDIE: No he, he moved out and I moved in.

CHANDLER: Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.

JOEY: I know I would.

EDDIE: Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong
apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.

JOEY: Hey no problem.

 CHANDLER: I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't
understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?

JOEY: Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other

tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.

PHOEBE: He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.

 MONICA: Ok. [Richard walks in] Hey, why don't you ask Richard?

JOEY: Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to
choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?

 RICHARD: Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you
should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.

CHANDLER: Ok, that's Eric.

RICHARD: Glad to be of help. Matches. [walks out to the balcony]

MONICA: I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?

JOEY: I don't know.

MONICA: C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.

 CHANDLER: I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh,
it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica
gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.

MONICA: So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if
you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off]

 JOEY: How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it
just to ride in the cool car?

CHANDLER: Ok, this could be tough.

JOEY: [Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if
he takes the Jaguar.

CHANDLER: Ooh, you almost had it.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is holding Ben.]

ROSS: [smells Ben's butt] No no, you're fine, you're fine.

CAROL: [enters with Susan] Hello

ROSS: Hi.

SUSAN: Hey.

CAROL: Hi honey.

ROSS: Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.

CAROL: What?

SUSAN: What?

 ROSS: Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he
grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you
guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.

CAROL: Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.

SUSAN: You can watch our tape if you want. 

ROSS: I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what,
the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he
spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?

CAROL: Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet,
but once he said yumen.

 ROSS: Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for
more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-

CAROL and SUSAN: Great. That would be fine.

ROSS: Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.

SUSAN: Oh shout, that would have been fun.

ROSS: Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's
never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are there. Phoebe enters carrying video tapes.]

PHOEBE: Hey.

RACHEL: Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?

PHOEBE: Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.

MONICA: Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've
got yourself a part-ay.

 PHOEBE: Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller
incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield
us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.

[Chandler and Joey enter]

CHANDLER: Hey.

JOEY: Hey.

RACHEL: Hey.

 MONICA: Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?

JOEY: Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter
with you, he's parking the car.

MONICA: So'd you guys have fun?

CHANDLER: Your boyfriend is so cool.

MONICA: Really?

 CHANDLER: Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me
for 15.

RACHEL: Wow, he must like you the best.

 JOEY: Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who
showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. [With money in his
palm] Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats [shakes his had and passes the
dollar].

CHANDLER: You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].

JOEY: No problem. Hey Chandler

CHANDLER: I think they get it.

JOEY: Ok.

[Richard enters]

CHANDLER: There's the man.

JOEY: He-he-eyy. [Shakes his had and passes the dollar]

RICHARD: Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.

JOEY: Ok. He kept my dollar.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Carol and Susan are dropping off Ben.]

MONICA: So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?

 CAROL: Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.

SUSAN: Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down
there.

ROSS: Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.

CAROL: Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.

ROSS: Buy mommy.

CAROL and SUSAN: We love you. Buy.

ROSS: Have a good time. Ok, Ben.

MONICA: Ross.

ROSS: Yeah.

 MONICA: Look. [they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his
mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here?

 JOEY: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than
me?

ROSS: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.

MONICA: You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.

JOEY: Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.

[Chandler enters with his hair full of mousse and a cheesy moustache]

 ROSS: Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.

CHANDLER: Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.

 MONICA: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?

JOEY: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew
it, we'd look like dorks.

ROSS: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.

CHANDLER: Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.

MONICA: You're meeting Richard?

JOEY: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.

CHANDLER: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?

MONICA: Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were
the guys.

CHANDLER: You hear that? We're the guys.

JOEY: We're the guys.

MONICA: With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?

ROSS: Thank you.

[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is working. Ross enters with Ben.]

 ROSS: Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you
say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.

RACHEL: No luck huh?

ROSS: Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into
sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I
gotta take this off.

RACHEL: Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]

 ROSS: What're you doing?

RACHEL: Uh, I'm holding Ben.

ROSS: Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.

RACHEL: Ok.

 ROSS: Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.

RACHEL: This is how I would hold a football.

ROSS: Ok, here, here. There we go.

RACHEL: Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around
them, I mean, you know, since I was one.

ROSS: It's alright, it's no big deal.

RACHEL: Really?

ROSS: Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.

RACHEL: What?

ROSS: What?

RACHEL: You think about stuff like that?

ROSS: Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.

RACHEL: Two, two babies?

ROSS: Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here
won't feel too competitive.

RACHEL: Then what's gonna happen?

ROSS: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.

RACHEL: Uh-huh.

ROSS: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we
don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit
whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau
county but the school system's supposedly great.

RACHEL: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.

ROSS: Huh?

RACHEL: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am
gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot.
I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a
door? [leaves]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are there. Phoebe enters.]

PHOEBE: Hey.

RICHARD: Hey Phoebs, what's happening?

PHOEBE: Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.

MONICA: So you watched the movies huh?

PHOEBE: Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and
and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.

RICHARD: Charlotte who?

PHOEBE: With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya
know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.

MONICA: Alright, you wanna feel better?

PHOEBE: Yeah.

MONICA: Ok, here, watch this.

 PHOEBE: It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.

MONICA: So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.

PHOEBE: Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I
was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.

RICHARD: Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?

PHOEBE: Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.

 CHANDLER: [runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.

RICHARD: Hey, be right there.

MONICA: There's a game?

CHANDLER: Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of
steel.

RICHARD: It's the basketball playoffs.

MONICA: Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with
them for me, I mean, they have each other.

 RICHARD: Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with
those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start
sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'

 MONICA: Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.

RICHARD: Uh, it's the college playoffs.

MONICA: Oh, then go Vassar.

RICHARD: Uh, they're not in it.

MONICA: Ok, then just go.

RICHARD: Ok. [leaves]

MONICA: Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people
who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.

PHOEBE: Sure.

 MONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know,
and I don't know, what do I do?

PHOEBE: Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow
your pets head off.

RACHEL: [enters] Aghh.

PHOEBE: Me too. [leaves]

MONICA: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.

RACHEL: Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.

 MONICA: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read
Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how
to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.

ROSS: [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?

RACHEL: I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next
thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.

 ROSS: Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're
at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.

RACHEL: Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for
six weeks.

ROSS: C'mon, what, you never think about our future?

 RACHEL: Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep
at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not
think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are
gonna be.

ROSS: No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I
thought, I thought that might be good.

RACHEL: What was the book?

ROSS: The big book of childrens' names.

RACHEL: Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.

ROSS: Yeah.

RACHEL: But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like
that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not
knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are
gonna have to deal with that.

ROSS: Ok fine.

RACHEL: Thank you.

ROSS: We're not done.

RACHEL: I didn't know that.

 ROSS: Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a
guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna
end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.

RACHEL: Fine, I will.

ROSS: Good, 'cause I love you.

RACHEL: Oh yeah.

ROSS: Yeah.

RACHEL: Well I love you too.

ROSS: Well that's the first time we've said that.

RACHEL: Yes it is.

ROSS: Well, I'm gonna kiss you.

RACHEL: Well you better.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen, Phoebe enters.]

 PHOEBE: Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.

MONICA: Did you like it?

PHOEBE: Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed
the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear
bleed.

MONICA: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty
wonderful?

 PHOEBE: I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept
getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when
you think it can't suck any more it does."

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are playing Richard at
foosball.]

CHANDLER: Kick save and... denied.

 RICHARD: But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up
and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?

JOEY: Man you are incredible.

 RICHARD: Well, we had a table in college.

CHANDLER: Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.

 RICHARD: Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's
really gonna kick in.

MONICA: [enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the
table.

RICHARD: Ok, just one more point.

MONICA: [grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?

CHANDLER: See, that's why we don't let her play.

RICHARD: Is everything all right?

MONICA: Um-hmm.

RICHARD: Uh-oh.

CHANDLER: Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin
so much of his time.

JOEY: Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.

RICHARD: Well.

 JOEY: No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean,
you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me
for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.

RICHARD: Uh, you guys see me as a dad?

JOEY: Oh yeah.

CHANDLER: No.

JOEY: Nooooo.

 CHANDLER: Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young
persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.

RICHARD: Uh-huh, yeah.

CHANDLER: No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down
at work.

RICHARD: That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and
I guess I'll just see you kids around.

MONICA: Nighty-nite.

CHANDLER: You're not a dad. You're not a dad.

JOEY: Not a dad.

CHANDLER: I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes
exception and slaps him back]

MONICA: [her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?

RICHARD: Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the
guys.

MONICA: Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool
guy, you suck at foosball.

RICHARD: What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.

MONICA: Yeah, well they suck too.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel is changing Ben's diaper under Ross's supervision.]

 ROSS: Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the
poopie diaper pail.

RACHEL: Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process
any cuter.

ROSS: [doorbell buzzes] Hello.

CAROL: It's us.

ROSS: Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. [walks in his room]

RACHEL: Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. [finishes the
diaper] There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.

BEN: Hi.

RACHEL: I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben
just said 'Hi'.

ROSS: Wha, what?

RACHEL: Ben just said hi.

 ROSS: What, the word hi?

RACHEL: Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.

ROSS: Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.

RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.

CAROL and SUSAN: Hello.

RACHEL: Guess what. Ben just said his first word.

CAROL: What did he say?

ROSS: Something about hi.

SUSAN: That's so exciting.

 CAROL: Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.

RACHEL: You know, actually it's more like, hi.

CAROL: Hi.

RACHEL: Hi.

CAROL: Hi.

RACHEL: Hi.

CAROL: Hi.

RACHEL: Hi.

CAROL: Hi.

SUSAN: Ok, this could go on for a while.

CAROL: We've got a cab waiting downstairs.

ROSS: Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok.
Alright so I've got him.

CAROL: Tuesday.

ROSS: Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.

RACHEL: Take care.

ROSS: Bye Ben.

BEN: Bye.

RACHEL: Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you
said bye to me. You said bye to me.

SUSAN: Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.

CAROL: We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.

ROSS: Alright, alright, ok. Bye.

BEN: Bye.

ROSS: Bye.

BEN: Bye.

ROSS: Bye.

BEN: Bye.

ROSS: Bye.

CLOSING CREDITS

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe is watching Bert and Ernie with Ben.]

ERNIE: Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a
nice hole here. Hey.

 PHOEBE: [pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie
buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does
find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while
but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well
so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]

ERNIE: Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a
moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.

PHOEBE: Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
END[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone is there. Monica is
watching stock prices on a business channel.]

 JOEY: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?

MONICA: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my
initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it
comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.

RACHEL: Ok honey, you really need a job.

ROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.

MONICA: Really.

 PHOEBE: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right
there.

ROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.

 PHOEBE: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I
keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I
passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.

EVERYONE: Ahh.

PHOEBE: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And
there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.

MONICA: His indian name?

PHOEBE: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean
coincidences? I don't think so.

ROSS: Freakish.

MONICA: Wow.

JOEY: Freaky.

MONICA: Weird, weird.

 RACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

PHOEBE: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.

MONICA: Why?

PHOEBE: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.

OPENING TITLES

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Ross enter in sweats carrying rackets.]

 CHANDLER: Man, I am so beat.

ROSS: Oh yeah.

CHANDLER: Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?

ROSS: Yeah alright.

[they sit at the couch]

 BIG BULLY: [walks back from the counter] Hey you're in our seats.

ROSS: Oh, sorry we didn't know.

LITTLE BULLY: [walks back from the counter] Hey, we were sitting there.

CHANDLER: Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?

 LITTLE BULLY: Is that supposed to be funny?

CHANDLER: No actually, I was just going for colorful.

BIG BULLY: What's with this guy?

LITTLE BULLY: What's with you?

ROSS: Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.

 [as they're walking off, little bully grabs Chandlers hat from
behind and puts it on himself]

CHANDLER: What just happened?

LITTLE BULLY: I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took
your hat.

CHANDLER: That, that is funny. Can I have it back?

LITTLE BULLY: No.

CHANDLER: No?

BIG BULLY: No.

ROSS: Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come
on guy just, just give him back the hat.

BIG BULLY: Why should we?

ROSS: Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See
he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself
up, ya know. Now Chandler...

CHANDLER: Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually
stealing my hat?

BIG BULLY: You got a problem with that?

CHANDLER: No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting there and Monica
walks in.]

RACHEL: Hey, how'd the interview go?

could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?

RACHEL: So don't do it.

MONICA: How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.

 CHANDLER: The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.

RACHEL: Noo.

JOEY: You're kiddin'.

RACHEL: Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug]

CHANDLER: Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.

 JOEY: Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.

CHANDLER: Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.

MONICA: [seeing TV] Hey, I went up.

RACHEL: What?

MONICA: My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had
invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya
know what, I'm gonna do it.

JOEY: Do what?

MONICA: Put all my money in me.

RACHEL: Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock

RACHEL: Are you kidding me?

PHOEBE: Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of
crap. [Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to the window.]
Ok, alright, we have a problem.

JOEY: Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.

RACHEL: Ok, here, I know what we can do. [grabs Joey's sadwich and throws it out the
window]

JOEY: Hey, hey, hey no.

through it.] Ahhh.

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Ross are sitting at the couch.]

CHANDLER: Hey.

ROSS: What?

 CHANDLER: Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to
wear those really cool jackets?

ROSS: Do you say this stuff to girls?

BIG BULLY: Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?

LITTLE BULLY: And look where they're sitting.

ROSS: You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.

BIG BULLY: Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

LITTLE BULLY: Yeah.

 BIG BULLY: This couch belongs to us.

CHANDLER: Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call
the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.

BIG BULLY: You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.

 ROSS: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther,
these guys are trying to take our seat.

GUNTHER: Fellas, these guys were here first.

BIG BULLY: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.

LITTLE BULLY: Sorry.

GUNTHER: There you go.

ROSS: Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.

 LITTLE BULLY: He told on us?

BIG BULLY: You told on us?

ROSS: Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's
tie]

CHANDLER: Don't play with his things.

ROSS: I know.

 BIG BULLY: Alright, let's take this outside.

ROSS: Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?

BIG BULLY: The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.

CHANDLER: You had to ask.

ROSS: Yeah.

[the bullies grab the back of the couch that Ross and Chandler are sitting in and tip
back]

 ROSS: Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight
you guys.

LITTLE BULLY: Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your
faces in this coffee house ever again.

CHANDLER: I think you played the Gunther card too soon.

[Scene: Back in the cab in front of Phoebe's dad's house.]

JOEY: Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.

PHOEBE: Yeah, I don't know.

RACHEL: What's the matter?

PHOEBE: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at
the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for
my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite
what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.
I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.

RACHEL: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.

JOEY: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?

PHOEBE: Ok, thanks. Sorry, again

[She starts the cab and pulls forward. We hear a squish and a dog yelp.]

 PHOEBE: [innocently] What was that?

JOEY: Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey is eating breakfast, Rachel has just gotten
up, and Monica is on the phone.]

MONICA: I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon
time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.

RACHEL: Time is money my friend?

JOEY: Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down
there and kick your wall street butt.'

 MONICA: Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?

JOEY: Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.

RACHEL: How did you make $17.

MONICA: Well, my financially challenged friends,  I split my money
and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.

JOEY: How come those?

MONICA: Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think
it sounds zexy.

RACHEL: What happened to uh, MEG.?

 MONICA: MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is
get out before they go down.

JOEY: That is so not my motto.

PHOEBE: [enters] Hey.

RACHEL: Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?

PHOEBE: Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the
little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.

JOEY: Good.

RACHEL: Oh, thank God.

 PHOEBE: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he
said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.

RACHEL: Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is
ok?

PHOEBE: I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone.  What am I
gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your
dog.'

JOEY: Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.

PHOEBE: Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone
that's sitting by Monica]

 MONICA: DON'T...be too long with the phone.

RACHEL: She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.

JOEY: [dials the phone] It's a woman.

PHOEBE: So talk to her.

 JOEY: [in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your
dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within,
within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]

RACHEL: Why the voice.

JOEY: [in the voice] Hard to say.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is sitting at the bar, Chandler serves up
two mugs of hot water.]

CHANDLER: Your cappucino sir.

ROSS: Thank you.

[they both pour in packets of cappucino mix]

CHANDLER: Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.

ROSS: Absolutely.

[they both stir thier coffee and proceed to stare into the mugs]

 ROSS: How come it's not mixing with the water?

CHANDLER:Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink,
stir and drink, never let it settle.

[they both try to drink while continuously stirring]

JOEY: [walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get
back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all
have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.

CHANDLER: Ok.

ROSS: No.

CHANDLER: No?

 ROSS: No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I
wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking
cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.

CHANDLER: Alright, hang on a second there Custer.

JOEY: Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?

ROSS: Yeah, sure.

JOEY: By someone besides Monica?

 ROSS: No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just
something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of
passage or somethin'.

CHANDLER: Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think
actually mine's growing back.

[Scene: Outside Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is returning.]

MONICA: [Opens the door] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.

RACHEL: What?

MONICA: Hi, welcome home. [pulls Rachel inside] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.

RACHEL: For what?

MONICA: I've gotta get back in the game.

RACHEL: Why, when did you get out of the game?

MONICA: I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.

RACHEL: Oh no.

MONICA: Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.

RACHEL: Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.

MONICA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?

RACHEL: I, I don't have it.

 MONICA: But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that
horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to
wear flame retardant boobs.

RACHEL: Nobody does honey.

[Scene: Phoebe's dad's house. Phoebe is returning the dog who is bandaged up and has a
plastic cone around it's neck.]

PHOEBE: Hi.

 MRS BUFFAY: Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?

PHOEBE: It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on
purpose. She's a vegetarian.

MRS BUFFAY: What are these, stitches?

PHOEBE: Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you
can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.

MRS BUFFAY: Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.

PHOEBE: Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.

MRS BUFFAY: How do you know Frank?

PHOEBE: Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?

MRS BUFFAY: Yeah. Frank.

FRANK: Yeah. What? [a young guy comes around the corner]

 PHOEBE: Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.

MRS BUFFAY: He went out for groceries.

PHOEBE: Ok so will he be back soon?

MRS BUFFAY: Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.

PHOEBE: Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.

[she turns to leave, Frank follows]

FRANK: Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?

PHOEBE: Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.

FRANK: Heavy.

PHOEBE: Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?

FRANK: No but he didn't really talk about anything.

PHOEBE: Oh.

FRANK: Except stilts.

PHOEBE: Stilts?

FRANK: Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my
mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past
the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always
happiest when he was on his stilts.

PHOEBE: Wow.

FRANK: Yeah.

PHOEBE: I don't know what to do with that.

 FRANK: Me neither. So you're like my big sister.

PHOEBE: Yeah.

FRANK: This is huge, you can buy me beer.

PHOEBE: I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named
Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'

FRANK: I gotta friend named Mark.

PHOEBE: That'll work too.

FRANK: Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk
or somethin'.

PHOEBE: Yeah, that'd be ok.

FRANK: Alright.

PHOEBE: Ok, I'm in the book.

FRANK: Ok, yeah.

PHOEBE: Alright. So um, stilts huh?

FRANK: Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit
his head on the rain gutter.

PHOEBE: Ok.

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Ross are sitting on the couch nervously.]

 ROSS: Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How
long does a cup of coffee take?

CHANDLER: Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.

[They rush to put the cream and sugar in their cups and gulp down a few drinks]

CHANDLER: Ah, there we go.

ROSS: I think we proved our point.

CHANDLER: You burn your mouth?

ROSS: Cannot feel my tounge.

[They leave. As they're walking out, the bullies are walking in.]

 CHANDLER: Bullies, big bullies.

LITTLE BULLY: Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.

BIG BULLY: Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.

ROSS: Yes, and that's why we're here.

CHANDLER: Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.

LITTLE BULLY: Let's do this alright.

ROSS: Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?

LITTLE BULLY: It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.

CHANDLER: Alright, let's do this.

LITTLE BULLY: Alright.

[they all put up their fists and prepare to fight]

CHANDLER: Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

ROSS: Whad'ya mean?

CHANDLER: Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage
with it.

BIG BULLY: No, you can't use your watch.

CHANDLER: Ok. [reaches in his pocket]

BIG BULLY: Or your keys.

CHANDLER: Ok.

LITTLE BULLY: Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over
there. Alright. [they all put their keys and watches in the hat and put it on a mail box]
Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.

[they all jump in the street and prepare to fight]

ROSS: Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

BIG BULLY: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?

ROSS: Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.

LITTLE BULLY: Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you
know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.

BIG BULLY: Ok, nothing from the neck up. [everyone gets ready for the fight] Or the waist
down. Dana's ovulating.

LITTLE BULLY: Oh really, you guys tryin' again?

BIG BULLY: Yeah.

CHANDLER: Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the
middle?

 BIG BULLY: C'MON!

ROSS: Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm
standin here, huh.

CHANDLER: Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! [some guy runs off with the hat]

ROSS: Hey.

BIG BULLY: Hey.

[they all run off after the guy]

[Scene: Central Perk. The four guys are returning after getting the hat back.]

 ROSS: God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You
guys, you guys kicked butt.

LITTLE BULLY: Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back
there. He was a big guy.

ROSS: Yeah he was wasn't he.

CHANDLER: Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.

BIG BULLY: Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little
girls jump-rope.

ROSS: So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?

LITTLE BULLY: We're ok.

ROSS: Alright.

CHANDLER: Ok so, can I have my hat back?

LITTLE BULLY: No.

CHANDLER: Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls
behind the couch]

CLOSING CREDITS

[Scene: The 50's theme cafe. Monica is working the grill, the rest are at a table.]

 RACHEL: Look at her.

CHANDLER: Hi Monica.

JOEY: He-he-he, how's it goin'?

PHOEBE: Hey nice boobs.

CHANDLER: Guys guys, check this out.

[Chandler puts a coin in the mini jukebox at the table. YMCA starts playing and Monica and
the rest of the staff have to get on the counter and start singing along and dancing.
After a couple of couruses, Chandler pulls out a handful of coins and drops them on the
table.]

JOEY: Excellent.
END[Scene: Moondance Diner. Ross, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are sitting at
the counter, Monica is working. Monica is wearing her costume, including big fake
breasts.]

MONICA: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's
birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.

ALL: Ohhh.

MONICA: What?

 ROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you
poach things?

MONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?

ROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?

JOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?

ROSS: Yeah.

 PHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.

MONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of
party you want.

[Joey is staring at Monica's breasts]

 MONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of
these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.

CHANDLER: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.

OPENING TITLES

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are planning Rache's
birthday party.]

ROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.

MONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

 JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.

PHOEBE: Why not her?

JOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.

CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called
her back.

MONICA: Joey that is horriable.

 JOEY: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know
I guess I just got scared.

PHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know.

JOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.

[Rachel enters]

 ROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?

RACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.

CHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.

 RACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My
sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what
a girl from long island would do for a Celica.

MONICA: So what happened?

RACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile
proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the
middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But
you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.

 PHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.

MONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?

CHANDLER: Why her mom?

MONICA: Cause I already invited her.

PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?

JOEY: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are setting
up for the party.]

PHOEBE: Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?

MONICA: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.

CHANDLER: Excuse me?

 MONICA: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

JOEY: Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.

[knock at the door]

MONICA: [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing
here?

MR. GREENE: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?

MONICA: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's
not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.

MR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.

MONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um,
this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.

 MR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal?
Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?

CHANDLER: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?

[knock at the door, Monica answers to see Mrs. Greene]

MRS. GREENE: Hi Monica.

[Monica slams the door back shut]

 MONICA: Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.

CHANDLER: So, basically just a Chinese guy.

JOEY: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's
bed.

MR. GREENE: Alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into Rachel's bedroom]

MRS. GREENE: Well, my goodness, what was that?

MONICA: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you
yet.

 MRS. GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?

CHANDLER: Yes because uh, you look so young.

PHOEBE: And because you're both, you know, white women.

MRS. GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

CHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.

MRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. [Chandler takes the hot pink
coat and grimaces at it] Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...
[Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a
cupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]

PHOEBE: [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the
rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun,
c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]

MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

 CHANDLER: Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?

JOEY: [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast
is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.

MONICA: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to
your place.

CHANDLER: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?

MONICA: Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.

JOEY: Right this is staging.

CHANDLER: Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.

JOEY: [as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday
sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the
hall]

[Scene: Later on in the hallway between the apartments. Chandler is showing people to
the parties.]

CHANDLER: Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's
apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment.
Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment]
Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.

MONICA: Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright
that's Ross.

CHANDLER: Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl
to take to his apartment]

RACHEL: Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.

ROSS: Thanks for being born.

 RACHEL: Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I
love you.

ROSS: Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.

RACHEL: Now I love you even more.

[they kiss and Ross backs her into her apartment and turns on the lights]

ALL: Surprise.

RACHEL: Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.

MRS. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetie.

RACHEL: Wow you, you. I had no idea.

ROSS: Really?

RACHEL: No, I knew.

ROSS: All right.

MONICA: Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.

ROSS: What?

RACHEL: What?

MONICA: Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.

RACHEL: Why.

MONICA: Just go.

[they walk across the hall]

ALL: Surprise.

MR. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetpea.

RACHEL: Daddy.

[Ad break. Time lapse. Still at party at Chandler and Joey's. Rachel is talking to
Chandler and Ross.]

 RACHEL: Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?

CHANDLER: Well, we could count again.

RACHEL: I can't believe this is happening.

 ROSS: You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday,
this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who
cares.

RACHEL: I do.

ROSS: That's who.

CHANDLER: Look, are you gonna be ok?

RACHEL: Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look
at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.

CHANDLER: Well, actually just one birthday flan.

RACHEL: What?

CHANDLER: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the
food committee.

[Time lapse. Chandler runs out of the bathroom.]

CHANDLER: Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,'
and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.

JOEY: Quick volleyball question.

CHANDLER: Volleyball.

 JOEY: Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really
like that grey lamp, did you?

CHANDLER: Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to
you.

GIRL'S VOICE: Dennis.

CHANDLER: Ok, that's me. [runs back]

RACHEL: Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.

 ROSS: Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?

RACHEL: Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you
should be ok.

[Back in Monica's party]

MONICA: Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your
most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put
the caps back on them because they will dry out.

[Back in Chandler and Joey's party]

 ROSS: Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular
surgery....game?

MR. GREENE: It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.

ROSS: I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are
already dead.

[Back in Monica's party]

MONICA: Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that
some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click.
[she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?

GUNTHER: I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...

MONICA: No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here,
here's your marker.

PHOEBE: Listen if you wanna go, just go.

GUNTER: No, she'll yell at me again.

PHOEBE: Alright, I can get you out.

GUNTHER: What?

PHOEBE: Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the
door and don't look back.

[Back at Chandler and Joey's party]

MR. GREENE: I think I need a drink.

ROSS: Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?

MR. GREENE: Scotch.

ROSS: Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a
glass.

MR. GREENE: Neat.

ROSS: Cool.

MR. GREENE: No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.

ROSS: I know.

[Back at Monica's party]

MR. GREENE: Oh hello Ross, where have you been?

ROSS: Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

MRS. GREENE: Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.

ROSS: Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? [walks out in the
hallway, Mr. Greene is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment] Hey, hey, where you
uh, sneakin off to mister?

MR. GREENE: I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.

ROSS: No. no.

MR. GREENE: Whad'ya mean no?

ROSS: No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there,
it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in
there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.

 MR. GREENE: Get my glasses too.

ROSS: All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first
time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses]

MONICA: Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.'
Very funny.

 PHOEBE: Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?

MONICA: What? [she runs over to where Phoebe is, Phoebe signals for Gunther to go] I don't
see anything.

PHOEBE: Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

MRS. GELLER: Ross, whose glasses are those?

ROSS: Mine.

MRS. GREENE: You wear bi-focals?

ROSS: Um-hmm. [puts them on] I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different
sets of focals.

MRS. GREENE: Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?

RACHEL: Well those are very popular frames.

ROSS: Neil Sedaka wears them.

GUY: [to Phoebe] I hear you can get people out of here.

MRS. GREENE: Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.

RACHEL: Yeah, like a chimney.

ROSS: Ohh, big smoker. [Packs the cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process.
Finally gets one in his mouth and it look really out of place] Big big smoker. In fact I'm
gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. [as he walks into the hall, he
comes face to face with Mr. Greene]

 MR. GREENE: Are you wearing my glasses?

ROSS: Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the
earpieces for you.

MR. GREENE: Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?

ROSS: [pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is,
I was just moistening the tip.

[Back in Monica's party. Phoebe is talking to a guy and two girls at the party.]

 PHOEBE: Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of
here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.

GIRL 1: What about my friend Victor?

PHOEBE: No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.

GIRL 1: Alright, let me just get my coat.

PHOEBE: There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.

GIRL 1: Is it true they have beer?

PHOEBE: Everything you've heard is true.

[Back at Chandler and Joey's party. Everyone is dancing and having fun.]

MONICA: Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle
tournament.

[Chandler and Joey stop dancing and laugh at her]

MONICA: You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing
here?

GUNTHER: Um [gestures to dance floor]

PHOEBE: [enters with the three people she got out] Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.

MONICA: Phoebe.

PHOEBE: Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's
Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.

MONICA: Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta
fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... [volleyball hits her in the
head from behind]

[Back at Monica's party]

RACHEL: You want me to see a therapist?

MRS. GREENE: Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly
like your father.

RACHEL: Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right
now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.

[Chandler and Joey's party]

MR. GREENE: Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like
Gulliver around that place.

RACHEL: Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but
I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.

[Monica's party]

MRS. GREENE: You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is
his stupid boat.

[Chandler and Joey's party]

MR. GREENE: You work and you work and you work on a boat...

MRS. GREENE: He always ridiculed my pottery classs...

MR. GREENE: ...and you sand it and you varnish it...

MRS. GREENE: ...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.

MR. GREENE: ...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...

MRS. GREENE: ...the scotch and the cigarettes...

MR. GREENE: ...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...

MRS. GREENE: ...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...

MR. GREENE: ...what the hell does she want with half a boat...

[Scene: The hallway after the party. Rachel is sitting there.]

CHANDLER: [running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll
be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger?
Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of
champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.

 RACHEL: This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna
be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in
some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through
this?

CHANDLER: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the
bed.

 RACHEL: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just
listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of
July.

CHANDLER: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?

RACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the
fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill
would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping
and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the
fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we
would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring
another one. And now it's just...

CHANDLER: I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]

[Scene: Monica's party. She is seeing off the last of the guests.]

MONICA: Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.

MRS. GREENE: Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on
the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.

MONICA: Ok will do. So glad you came.

MRS. GREENE: I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.

MONICA: Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.

RACHEL: Oh ok.

MRS. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetie.

RACHEL: Ok.

[Mr. Greene opens the door to Chandler and Joeys apartment. Ross sees him and runs to the
door forcing him back in then holds onto the door knob.]

JOEY: Ahh, you drive safe.

MRS. GREENE: Ross, what're you doing.

ROSS: I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross
in] How are you doing?

CHANDLER: Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?

MR. GREENE: To get my coat.

GUYS: No no no.

MR. GREENE:Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.

[the guys form a wall between Mrs Geller and Mr Geller and dance across the hall as he
walks across]

 CHANDLER: Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

PHOEBE: Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's
all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there]
Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.

MR. GREENE: I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.

PHOEBE: Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.

JOEY: Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes
limp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.

MRS. GREENE: Oh, you kids [she caresses his face and chest] Well, this is the best party
I've been to in years.

MONICA: Thank you.

CLOSING CREDITS

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Close up of the flan on the table with birthday
candles.]

 MONICA: Ok everybody, it's time for flan.

CHANDLER: Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.

JOEY: Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.

MONICA: Ok, that's enough.

 PHOEBE: Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.

RACHEL: Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the
volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.
END[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are there.]

[Rachel brings a muffin to Chandler and Monica who are sitting on the couch.]

 RACHEL: Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.

[Rachel holds the tray between them. Chandler grabs the muffin before Monica can.]

MONICA: Oh, I ordered mine first.

CHANDLER: Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...

MONICA: Give it to me.

CHANDLER: No.

MONICA: Give it to me.

CHANDLER: Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]

 MONICA: [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.]
There you go, enjoy your coffee.

CHANDLER: That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]

PHOEBE: [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.

MONICA: [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the
muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.

PHOEBE: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.

[Chandler is visibly upset]

RACHEL: You went out with a guy in the Navy?

PHOEBE: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in
salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.

JOEY: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?

PHOEBE: No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have
the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole
weeks, which means yay.

 RACHEL: So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?

[Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can't come back.]

MONICA: That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

ROSS: [enters] Hiii.

JOEY: Oh no, what happened?

ROSS: Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.

ALL: Oh no.

ROSS: Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.

RACHEL: Well I've had it.

JOEY: Yeah, I've had it.

MONICA: Had it.

CHANDLER: Had it.

PHOEBE: Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh
look!

OPENING TITLES

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are in her bedroom.]

 MONICA: Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to
do that. This isn't camp.

RICHARD: Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am
going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.

[He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]

RICHARD: Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover
it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the
fattest man in the whole damn town?

MONICA: Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.

RICHARD: What're you doing?

MONICA: Just waiting for you sweetie.

RICHARD: Are you remaking the bed?

MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.

RICHARD: Then, you're redoing it because...

 MONICA: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

RICHARD: You're pretty much running that risk either way.

MONICA: Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the
bottom right corner.

 RICHARD: Oh, well that's not so crazy.

MONICA: I'm just easing you in.

RICHARD: Oh, alright.

MONICA: Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down,
because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more
do you.

RICHARD: Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

 MONICA: Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey is there.]

CHANDLER: Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can
get you a job right here as an entry level processor.

JOEY: But don't you need experience for a job like that?

CHANDLER: It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what
you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a
processor.

SCOTT: [enters] Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.

CHANDLER: Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.

SCOTT: No kidding.

 JOEY: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the
one they call.

SCOTT: Where do you work?

JOEY: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're
processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.

CHANDLER: I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.

SCOTT: Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...

JOEY: Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Rachel are doing Phoebe's makeup.]

RACHEL: Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.

MONICA: You look fabulous honey, you really do.

PHOEBE: Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches
all over her face.]

 RACHEL: You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.

PHOEBE: I, I, I'm hideous.

 MONICA: It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna
be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ryan is walks up to the door and knocks.]

PHOEBE: Come in.

RYAN: Hey baby, I'm back... [Phoebe is sitting by the window in a veil.]

PHOEBE: Hey Ryan, what's up?

RYAN: What's goin' on?

 PHOEBE: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.

RYAN: Chicken or small?

PHOEBE: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.

RYAN: Why aren't you at home in bed?

PHOEBE: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you
have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.

RYAN: I'm sorry, I never had 'em.

PHOEBE: Ohh, ohh.

 RYAN: If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go
back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub
him all over my face.

PHOEBE: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.

RYAN: Can I please see your face?

PHOEBE: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.

RYAN: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.

PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is
me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in
terror.] Oh, I am scary.

RYAN: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely,
lovely.

 PHOEBE: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two
weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than
this.

RYAN: Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about
this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her
and kisses her.]

PHOEBE: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.

[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey enters.]

JOEY: Hey.

CHANDLER: Hey, how's the first day goin'?

JOEY: Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column
into another column.

CHANDLER: Well there you go.

JOEY: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red
hair, Jeannie.

CHANDLER: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?

 JOEY: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world
huh?

CHANDLER: Weird world. Your kids?

 JOEY: I figure my character has kids.

CHANDLER: Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.

 JOEY: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff
like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and
Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

CHANDLER: Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.

 JOEY: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a
third kid... Ya know what? Just did.

CHANDLER: Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Ryan are playing Monopoly.]

RYAN: You know what makes the itching even worse?

PHOEBE: That you don't stop talking about it.

RYAN: Fine.

PHOEBE: Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes,
here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama,
just getting ready to roll the dice...

RYAN: What're you doing? Are you scratching?

PHOEBE: No. This is what I do for luck, ok.

RYAN: You're scratching. Give me the dice.

PHOEBE: No.

RYAN: Give me the dice.

PHOEBE: No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.

RYAN: We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.

PHOEBE: Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all
these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]

RYAN: No.

PHOEBE: Give it.

RYAN: No.

PHOEBE: Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just
be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]

RYAN: Oh God help me.

PHOEBE: Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.

[They get back to back and start rubbing against each other. Ross and Rachel enter.]

RACHEL: Oh, stop that, stop that right now.

ROSS: You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.

[Scene: Chandler's office building. Joey and Jeannie are talking.]

JOEY: You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the
kids, we'll make a day of it.

JEANNIE: Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

JOEY: Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.

 JEANNIE: Bye bye Joey.

JOEY: What a phony.

CHANDLER: Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto
nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.

JOEY: Sir.

MR. DOUGLAS: Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the
systems report until next Friday?

CHANDLER: Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.

MR. DOUGLAS: I have a family, I'm gonna be here.

JOEY: Yeah Bing, what's that about?

CHANDLER: It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you
wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.

MR. DOUGLAS: Rough numbers?

JOEY: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.

MR. DOUGLAS: Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.

CHANDLER: Uh, if you say so sir.

JOEY: Joseph's good, isn't he?

CHANDLER: Well, I'm going to kill you.

JOEY: Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get
in there, ruffle some feathers.

CHANDLER: Why?

JOEY: Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll
call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica enters her bedroom with a roll of duct
tape. Richard is sitting on the bed.]

RICHARD: Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?

MONICA: This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.

RICHARD: You're strict.

MONICA: It's for their own good.

 RICHARD: You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this
tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.

 MONICA: Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around
you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that
everything on your desk is perpendicular?

RICHARD: If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.

MONICA: Very good.

RICHARD: Thank you.

MONICA: You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.

RICHARD: You're gonna do what to my clocks.

MONICA: I'm gonna set them to my time.

RICHARD: Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.

 MONICA: No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
You wanna know why?

RICHARD: Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.

MONICA: No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.

RICHARD: No come on. Come on tell me.

MONICA: No. See you don't understand.

RICHARD: Come on.

MONICA: No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.

RICHARD: No that's not true. That is not true.

MONICA: Oh yeah.

RICHARD: Yeah.

MONICA: Alright, well tell me one of yours.

RICHARD: Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress
socks.

MONICA: What if they get mixed up?

RICHARD: Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.

 MONICA: You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too
normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a
thing.

RICHARD: See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.

[Scene: Chandler's office. Chandler is asleep in his chair holding a paper in one hand
and a pen in the other. Joey walks in, waking up Chandler who covers by pretending to
write on the paper.]

JOEY: Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

CHANDLER: Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

JOEY: 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

CHANDLER: Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?

JOEY: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns
out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.

CHANDLER: Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a
lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not
possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

JOEY: What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.

CHANDLER: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.

JOEY: Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your
department.

CHANDLER: Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.

JOEY: Karen.

 CHANDLER: Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her.
Oh, you know what? I just did.

JOEY: Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.

 CHANDLER: Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the
rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the
next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.

JOEY: Really?

CHANDLER: No freakshow, she's fictional.

JOEY: Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.

CHANDLER: Thank you.

JOEY: It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
[Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Ross are in the kitchen. Phoebe is
sitting at the couch with oven mits on her hands.]

PHOEBE: Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.

RACHEL: No sorry hon, Monica's orders.

RYAN: [Comes out of the bathroom, also with oven mits on his hands.] Well that wasn't
easy.

ROSS: Ok, dinner's on.

RACHEL: And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but
that shouldn't be a problem for you.

ROSS: Alright you kids, bye now.

PHOEBE and RYAN: Bye. [waving]

 ROSS: Oh look, a low budget puppet show.

PHOEBE: It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.

[Ross and Rachel leave.]

RYAN: Wine?

PHOEBE: Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]

RYAN: Oh, I spilled some.

PHOEBE: I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]

RYAN: [Puts his hands over Phoebe's ears.] I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.

PHOEBE: What?

RYAN: Sorry. You look beautiful.

PHOEBE: Oh.

[They start to kiss. They try to get each other's shirts off but can't get the buttons
undone.]

PHOEBE: You know what, that's it, that's it. [She rips off the mits, Ryan follows her
lead.]

[They keep kissing and start scratching each other. Ross enters, takes one look, and goes
right back out the door.]

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Richard and Monica are in bed.]

RICHARD: Monica, wake up. Monica.

MONICA: What's up?

RICHARD: I thought of a thing.

MONICA: Yeah?

RICHARD: Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.

MONICA: No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on
this side of the bed.

RICHARD: Or so I would have you believe.

MONICA: No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.

RICHARD: Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.

MONICA: Alright, go on.

RICHARD: Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and
otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.

MONICA: Oh my God, you're a freak.

RICHARD: Yeah. How 'bout that.

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe, Rachel, Ross, and Ryan are there. Ryan is in uniform,
getting ready to leave.]

 RACHEL: So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?

RYAN: I really can't say.

ROSS: So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?

RYAN: I can't say.

RACHEL: Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.

RYAN: I'm sorry, but I can't say.

ROSS: Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.

RYAN: I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.

PHOEBE: Ok, I'll walk you out.

ROSS: Bye Ryan.

RYAN: Pleasure.

RACHEL: It was nice to meet you.

RYAN: Take care.

[Phoebe and Ryan walk outside.]

RACHEL: So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?

ROSS: You like that do ya?

RACHEL: Oh yeah.

ROSS: I'll make some calls. [Runs off.]

RACHEL: Ok.

[Outside with Phoebe and Ryan.]

RYAN: Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?

 PHOEBE: I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had
planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I
just got that. [They kiss.]

RYAN: Taxi.

PHOEBE: Bye you. [Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central
Perk sign in the window and laughs.]

Rachel: No, it's been three nights in a row.
Ross: Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of
Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Phoebe: Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I
could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a
opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the
phone call.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is coming in from the bedroom]
Chandler: Morning.
Joey: Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Chandler: Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Janice: (entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man
to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.
Joey: (sarcastically) Good morning.
Chandler: Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from
work today and just hang out with me.
Janice: Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go
see my lawyer. 
Chandler: I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting
divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Janice: (laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Chandler: Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Joey: (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!
Janice: I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Joey: B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Chandler: Nope, not this time.
Joey: Come on, quite yankin' me.
Chandler: I'm not yanking you.
Joey: This is Janice.
Chandler: Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Joey: Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,
that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Chandler: (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at
each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)
[Scene: Rachel and Monica's, Monica is entering from the bathroom.]
Monica: God, look what I found in the drain.
Rachel: What?!
Monica: It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with
this?
Ross: Getting it away from me would be job one.
Monica: It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this
is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)
Phoebe: Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your
cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down
the drain.)
Monica: God, what is wrong with me.
Ross: You need to get some sleep.
Monica: I need to get some Richard.
Rachel: Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Monica: I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of
wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Phoebe: Maybe, because you told him not to.
Monica: What are you the memory woman?
Joey: (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking
up. He didn't blink or anything.
Rachel: Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,
they're really cute.
Joey: Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Rachel: Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his
girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Joey: There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All
right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ross: Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,
so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Joey: Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
[Scene: Ross's bedroom, Ross is working and Rachel is reading a book in bed]
Rachel: (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....
Ross: Hmm?
Rachel: Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Ross: Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Rachel: Hmm.
Ross: I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Rachel: You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Well honey, what about you?
Ross: What?
Rachel: I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Ross: No.
Rachel: Come on you gotta have one!
Ross: Nope.
Rachel: Ross, you know what...
Ross: What?
Rachel: ...if you tell me, I might do it.
Ross: Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as
his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. 
Rachel: Oooh!
Ross: Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty
cool.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there]
Phoebe: Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved
that.
Rachel: Really!
Phoebe: Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she
stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Rachel: Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Rachel: Really! That-that great huh?
Phoebe: No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Ross: (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
Rachel: Hi you guys!
Ross: Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a
parking meter.
Rachel: Mon. Hi! 
Monica: Hi.
Rachel: Why aren't you at work?
Monica: Oh, they-they sent me home.
Rachel: Why?
Monica: Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Ross: Okay.
Rachel: You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Monica: I know I do.
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Hi.
Ross: Guess what?
Rachel: What?
Ross: They published my paper.
Rachel: Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Phoebe: Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look
like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.
(Ross stands up horrified) There he is.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching Wheel of Fortune, the puzzle is showing
_oun_ Rush_ore.]
[Chandler enters]
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Wheel!
Chandler: Of!
Joey: Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!
Chandler: You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got
three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Joey: I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Chandler: No, Janice.
Joey: Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go
together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Chandler: You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a
problem with Janice?
Joey: No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler
follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the
Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?
Chandler: Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Joey: Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Chandler: Well, there you go.
Joey: Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you
nuts before too, remember?
Chandler: Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.
Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Joey: Look, what do you want me to say?
Chandler: I want you to say that you like her!
Joey: I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts
laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have
something to throw at her. 
Chandler: Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by
the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Joey: Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are entering]
Ross: How could you have told her? 
Rachel: Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Ross: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Rachel: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Ross: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Rachel: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other
everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that
locker room stuff.
Ross: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who
did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Rachel: Were both of those Joey?
Ross: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your
girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Rachel: Not even with your best friend.
Ross: Noo!
Rachel: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding
and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same
thing you are.
Ross: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Rachel: Pretty much.
Ross: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the
night of five times? 
Rachel: Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Ross: I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
[Scene: Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is trying to relax her.]
Phoebe: ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the
plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me
your happy place.
Monica: Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Phoebe: All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And
get out!
Monica: I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Phoebe: Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to
ask that you don't move anything.
Monica: All right, I'll try not to.
Phoebe: Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Monica: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Phoebe: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the
warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Monica: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Phoebe: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not
permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and
the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Monica: Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's]
Janice: So, I hear, you hate me!
Joey: I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Janice: A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off
and throw it at me.
Joey: And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Janice: All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about
our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time
together.
Joey: But what does that gonna do...
Janice: For Chandler!
Joey: Okay. I'm in.
Janice: Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY
OF FUN!'
Joey: Does it have to be a whole day?
Janice: Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Joey: Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are entering]
Monica: (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Phoebe: Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Monica: Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,
and Phoebe leave)
Ross: Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Chandler: Umm, yeah.
Ross: No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,
stamina, girth....
Chandler: Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? 
Ross: Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing
it. Do you wanna?
Chandler: We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Ross: Nooo!
Chandler: Yeah, okay.
Ross: Yeah?
Chandler: Yeah! All right! You go first.
Ross: Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Chandler: Okay.
Ross: So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,
and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Chandler: Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Ross: Yes! 
Chandler: I know!
Ross: Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Chandler: Okay.
Ross: Okay.
Chandler: Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Ross: Hmph.
Chandler: And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these
like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the
Xerox place....
Ross: With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Chandler: I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And
your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't
possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's
kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!
Ross: Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the
matter with you?
Chandler: You said...
Ross: I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler
goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Janice are returning from their DAY OF FUN!]
Janice: We're baack!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: What are you guys doing together?
Janice: Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! (laughs)
Chandler: Really.
Joey: Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I
love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Janice: I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.
I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)
Chandler: You still can't stand her can you?
Joey: I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Chandler: Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Joey: But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea
Stadium.
Chandler: Well, I guess that's something.
Joey: No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means
I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Chandler: Okay.
Joey: Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into
Ross.
Chandler: Oh God!
Joey: Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Chandler: Really?
Joey: Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
[Scene: Rachel and Monica's, Monica is watching the Civil War videos]
Video:April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, Sixty-One (Monica lights
Richard's cigar butt), 4:30 A.M. on Tuesday, the United States garrison at Fort Sumter was
fired upon (knock on door) it is now under bombardment by.... 
(Monica answers the door)
Monica: Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Mr. Geller: Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come
into the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Monica: I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you
really doing here Dad?
Mr. Geller: Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Monica: What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Mr. Geller: I saw Richard.
Monica: Oh.
Mr. Geller: So, how are you doing?
Monica: I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Mr. Geller: You don't wanna know.
Monica: No, I really, really do.
Mr. Geller: Well, he's doing terrible!
Monica: Really!
Mr. Geller: Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Monica: You're not just saying that are you?
Mr. Geller: No, the man is a mess.
Monica: Was he crying?
Mr. Geller: No.
Monica: Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Mr. Geller: Maybe.
Monica: I think so.
Mr. Geller: Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know
after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather,
wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's
nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns
around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks
up the cigar, and starts watching the video)
Closing Credits
[Scene: Ross's bedroom, Ross is humming the Star Wars theme. Rachel enters, with her
hair done up like Princess Leia's, and wearing a belly dancer's outfit, to simulate the
gold bikini thing.]
Rachel: Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look
on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?
Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Ross: No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom
standing where Rachel is)
Mrs. Geller: Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me
out here.
Ross: I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around
and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)

EndChandler: Taste it.

Joey: (drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drank
fat!

Chandler: Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.

Ross: (entering) Hey!

Chandler: Hey, mister tux!

Ross: Why aren't you guys dressed?

Joey: We have a half hour.

Ross: No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at
twenty to eight. 

Joey: Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.

Ross: Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.

Chandler and Joey: Okay. (they don't move)

Rachel: (entering from bathroom) Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.

Ross: Really.

Rachel: Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.

Ross: Hi.

Rachel: How come you didn't come over earlier?

Ross: 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.

Joey: Hey, Ross, want some cider?

Ross: No. (to Rachel) So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on,
hair's done. 

Rachel: Yeah, I just have to get dressed.

Ross: Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.

Rachel: Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.

Joey: Glass of fat?

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Ross is acting nervous]

Joey: What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?

Ross: No! Do you wanna hear it?

Joey: Am I in it?

Ross: Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I
sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.

Phoebe: (entering) Hello.

Ross: Hey!

Joey: Whoa!

Ross: Wow, hello! You look great!

Phoebe: Thank you! I know, though.

Ross: You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my
star.

Phoebe: Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.

Chandler: (entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took the
quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.

Joey: What?

Chandler: You're in my seat.

Joey: How is this your seat?

Chandler: 'Cause I was sitting there.

Joey: But then you left.

Chandler: Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I
was coming back.

Joey: What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.

Chandler: The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.

Joey: Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the
bathroom). Soo...

Ross: You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both
have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..

Chandler: All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a
big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!

Monica: (entering) Hi.

All: Hey.

Monica: Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!

Phoebe: All right all ready.

Monica: (to Ross) Ooh, are you gonna do magic?

Ross: That's, that's funny. Change!

Monica: Hang on a second I just got in.

Ross: Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.

Phoebe: We could not, would not want to wait.

Ross: Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone
will see if we arrive after it starts.

Monica: Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other)

Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) You guys, (holds up an outfit) does this look
like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?

Phoebe: I don't know, you might be the first one.

Monica: Rach, did you check the machine?

Rachel: Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look
fat. Nevermind.

Chandler: Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.

Joey: All right! You can have the chair.

Chandler: Really!

Joey: Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)

Phoebe: (on machine) "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm
already there when your playing this message?" (to the guys) Is that too spooky?

Ross: (on machine) "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel.
Rach!"

Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) What?!

Ross: Nevermind.

Richard: (on machine) "Monica, it's Richard. Call me."

Monica: Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!

Ross: It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?

Monica: What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had
something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?

Chandler: Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.

Ross: Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the
same thing. And you know what I did?

Monica: Huh?

Ross: I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts to
follow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There we
go, there we go.

Chandler: You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just
hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in
front of Joey's face) Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not
touching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)

Phoebe: Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!

Chandler and Joey: Sorry Phoebe.

Joey: I'm so sorry.

Phoebe: What am I gonna do?

Ross: No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! (clapping) What gets out hummus?! What
gets out hummus?!

Phoebe: Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.

Monica: If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?

Phoebe: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

Chandler: Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.

Monica: So, should I call him back?

The Guys: Noo! (Monica starts to go back into her room and stops) NO!

Chandler: All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on
Joey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.

Joey: Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.

Chandler: All right! (jumps up)

Ross: Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and
change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated
the chair. Okay. Okay.

Chandler: All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and
I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)

Rachel: (entering from her room) Is this a little too... (sees Phoebe) Pheebs, what
happened?

Phoebe: Hummus. I got the hummus.

Rachel: Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black
jacket? 

Phoebe: That won't go with this dress though.

Rachel: No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of
that. Come on.

Ross: No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.

Rachel: Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

Monica: I called him.

All: Nooo.

Monica: Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God,
what if it wasn't breezy? 

Phoebe: Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a
breezy place.

Monica: Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me
if it's breezy enough.

Joey: Monica, how are you gonna do that?

Monica: I know the code to his answering machine.

Ross: Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are
dialing.
(Chandler enters, and Joey is standing near the chair, they have a show down to see who
gets the chair and Joey wins)

Richard: (on machine) "Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at
the tone."

Machine: "You have two new messages."

Joey: Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'You have two new messages.'
'Please, pass the pie.'

Monica: (on machine) "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this
message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So
let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."

Joey: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.

Woman's Voice: (on machine) Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me
about this weekend, okay.

Joey: Now she sounded breezy.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier]

Monica: He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.

Phoebe: Monica, you don't know that.

Monica: Well, who's voice was that?

Chandler: Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.

Monica: Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?

Ross: Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.

Monica: It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.

Rachel: Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't
work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!

Ross: You don't, you don't know what your wearing?

Rachel: Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.

Ross: Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right,
come on, I'll just pick something out for you.

Chandler: All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have
noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair,
dillhole!"

Joey: Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)

Chandler: What are you doing?

Joey: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the
cushions.

Chandler: The cushions are the essence of the chair!

Joey: That's right! I'm taking the essence.

Chandler: Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.

Ross: Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.

Rachel: Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this
thing as Little Bo Peep.

Ross: Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.

Rachel: Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.

Phoebe: Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! (she's wearing another
dress on a hanger around her neck)

Rachel: Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

Phoebe: Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!

Ross: Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?

Rachel: No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.

Chandler: We used them as pillows when we went camping.

Ross: What?

Chandler: (shyly) The sheep.

Ross: Hey, what you do on your own time...

Joey: (entering) Where's my underwear?!

Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?

Chandler: He took my essence!

Ross: Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're
wearing now?

Joey: Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.

Ross: Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?

Joey: It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.

Chandler: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his
cushions.

Joey: Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.

Chandler: What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?

Joey: Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)

Chandler: He's got nothing!

Phoebe: (entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay,
I'm ready.

Ross and Chandler: Oh, aaaah!

Phoebe: Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas
ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'

Chandler: What are you supporting?

Phoebe: Duh!! Christmas!

Ross: Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve
minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. (shows Chandler) Okay, see, the, the dinosaur
tail isn't going around any more. (grabs Chandler's watch) What time is it? It's 7:33, I
have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!

Rachel: (entering from her room) Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The
black or the purple?

Ross: Just, just, just pick one!

Phoebe: Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little
strappys?

Rachel: Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear
pants?

Ross: Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without
any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in
there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.

Rachel: But I...

Ross: No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.

Rachel: All right.

Ross: Thank you!

Monica: (entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that
was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.

Ross: It was, it was her voice.

Chandler: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.

Michelle: Hola! Hello. Hello?

Monica: Okay. That was her right?

Phoebe: Definitely.

Monica: See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.

Ross: Yay!
(phone rings)

Phoebe: I'll get it, okay. (answers phone) Hi, Monica and Rachel's. (listens) Yeah,
just a second, can I ask who's calling. (to Monica) Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she
must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that. 

Monica: (on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by
mistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss
him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....

Chandler: (to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But
whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean,
what is that about?

Monica: (on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean
that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if
you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come
on we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.

Ross: No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Monica: Okay, fine. (runs to her room)

Chandler: They got a phone in there, right?

Phoebe: Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
(Rachel comes out from her room wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt)

Ross: Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a
little, um.

Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo.

Ross: You're not going to go.

Rachel: No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.

Ross: How, how, um how can you not be going?

Rachel: I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.

Ross: Um, you know, just out of curiosity...

Rachel: Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm
just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.

Ross: Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.

Rachel: It's fine.

Ross: No, but, your-your mad.

Rachel: I'm not mad. 

Ross: No.

Rachel: I'm just not going.

Ross: Your not going.

Rachel: Right.

Ross: Okay. You know that I-I have to go.

Rachel: Um, hum.

Ross: Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'

Rachel: No.

Ross: No, because your not upset.

Rachel: Right.

Ross: About the yelling.

Rachel: Right, and the humiliating.

Ross: Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.

Rachel: Um, hum.

Ross: We're good.

Rachel: Right.

Ross: Okay. Honey?

Rachel: Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)

Ross: I love you. (goes to kiss her and she turns away.)

Phoebe: (yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into the
living room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed.

Chandler: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
(Joey enters wearing a lot of clothes)

Joey: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you
own.

Chandler: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!! 

Joey: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe
if I wasn't going commando...

Chandler: Oooo-ooh!

Joey: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I
don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)

Ross: Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've
had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!

Chandler: Jeez, what a baby.

Joey: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.

Ross: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is
the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I
wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what
can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.

Joey: You could drink the fat.

Ross: Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.

Rachel: No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.

Ross: What?

Rachel: I think you should drink the fat.

Joey: Yaaaay!

Ross: Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and
how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.

Phoebe: Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.

Ross: I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake,
with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. (starts to drink, but Rachel stops him just
before he starts drinking)

Rachel: No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!

Ross: You will?!

Rachel: You were really gonna do that, weren't you?

Ross: Well, yeah.

Rachel: You were gonna drink the fat.

Joey: Let's see what else he'll do!

Ross: (to Joey) How 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to Chandler) You, give him
back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two
minutes! Monica! 
(Joey and Chandler start to leave, Joey is lunging as he is walking)

Chandler: Stop it. Stop it!
(Monica runs into the living room, and starts dialing the phone)

Phoebe: Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No,
Monica, no!

Richard: (on machine) Hi, this is Richard.

Machine: You have three new messages.

Monica: Not any more!

Machine: Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.

Monica: Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy
tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I
beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know
what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can
forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.

Machine: Your outgoing message has now been changed.

Monica: Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!

Monica: (on machine) "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something
kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."
Nooo!!

Phoebe: How did you do that?

Monica: I don't know!

Machine: Good-bye.

Monica: Noooo!!!!

Ross: (entering) Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!

Monica: Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message.
Maybe they can change his number. 

Phoebe: Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.

Ross: Rachel!! (she enters) Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!

Rachel: And I still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) Okay, that was
about seven seconds.

Ross: So we're a little late.

Rachel: Come on. (they start to leave) Oh! And, uh, by the way....

Ross: What?

Rachel: I'm going commando, too.

Ross: Awwww!!!

Closing Credits

[Scene: At the banquet]

Sherman Whitfield: Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.

Ross: Wow! What a pleasure.

Whitfield: (sits down) Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your
paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.

Chandler: Excuse me. Hi.

Whitfield: Yes?

Chandler: Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.

Whitfield: What do you mean, your seat?

Chandler: I mean, I was sitting there.

Whitfield: But, you got up!

Chandler: But, I never left the room!

Whitfield: But, you left the chair area.

Chandler: All right, that's it, give me your underwear.

End[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting reading a book and hears the bed in
Joey's room creaking, and does a 'Oh no, not again' look on his face.]
Joey: (from bedroom) WHOAA!!
Chandler: (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not
to jump on the bed.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]
Monica: Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this
morning.
Ross: Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Monica: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Rachel: I didn't know there were docks.
[Joey and Chandler enter]
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: Aww, is it broken?
Joey: No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is
wearing)
Rachel: Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Joey: Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Chandler: Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it
just *fell* out of the socket.
Joey: What is this? Fruit?
Rachel: Monica's making jam.
Joey: Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at
our place?
Chandler: Because the kids need new shoes.
Monica: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed
about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?
Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey
realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)
Joey: This will just be my batch.
[Scene: Street, Phoebe is being followed by some guy, as they pass a flower vendor.
Phoebe turns around and the guy quickly picks up some flowers and continues following
her.]
Phoebe: (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have
you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Guy: You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
Phoebe: What?
Guy: One more chance Ursula, please?
Phoebe: Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. 
Guy: Wh..
Phoebe: Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Guy: Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Phoebe: Oh, you're not a dingus.
Guy: I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet
your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Phoebe: Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is
just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Guy: Well thanks. (starts to leave)
Phoebe: Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in
Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was
this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He
said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Guy: Not really.
Phoebe: Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice
guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Guy: Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice.
Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)
Phoebe: Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Guy: Yeah, okay.
Phoebe: Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't
have to walk behind me any more.
Guy: Sorry.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]
Rachel: Mon?
Ross: Mon?
Rachel: (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Ross: Wait a minute, look.
Rachel: What?
Ross: Look, look, look.
Rachel: What, what, what?
Ross: It's an empty apartment.
Rachel: Oooh.
Ross: We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Rachel: Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts
kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
(they fall onto the couch)
(Chandler enters and they both jump up and pretend that Ross is showing her something
in the couch.)
Ross: There it is.
Rachel: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Chandler: Do I look fat?
Ross and Rachel: Noo.
Chandler: Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that
to mean that I was calling her a cow. 
Rachel: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Chandler: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at
her....
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's
just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Rachel: Nooo!
Ross: And it works both ways.
Chandler: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Rachel: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Ross: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she
gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2
is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Chandler: That's easy, baggage claim.
Ross: (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number
three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Chandler: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice
likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to
go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,
accidentally calling her fat or something.
Rachel: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily
sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.
Ross: Oh.
Rachel: All right are you guys gonna come down?
Ross: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Rachel: Good luck Chandler.
Chandler: Thank you Rachel.
Ross: Bye sweetie.
Rachel: Bye hon.
Ross: (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but
there is something you can do.
Chandler: Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Ross: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.
Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and
thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...
Chandler: Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
Ross: I'm gonna use the cushion.
Chandler: Yeah.
Ross: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for
her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back
over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Chandler: Okay, the old hug and roll.
Ross: Yep.
Chandler: Okay, one question.
Ross: Shoot.
Chandler: You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is putting jam on his muffin, lots of jam]
Joey: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the
movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Rachel: (Looks at him) You're so pretty.
Phoebe: (entering) Hi!
All: Hey, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him
today.
Joey: (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Phoebe: Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his
name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was
Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause
of the restraining order.
Chandler: Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Phoebe: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this
very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you
know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Ross: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Phoebe: No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you
know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Joey: (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with
crumbs) 
Phoebe: Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Monica: (entering) Hey guys.
All: Hey Mon.
Monica: Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.
Joey: Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!
Chandler: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds
up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
Joey: Put your hands together.
Monica: Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Joey: No more jam?!
Rachel: Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Monica: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.
So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Chandler: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Ross: What are you talking about?
Monica: I'm talking about me having a baby.
Ross: What?
Rachel: Are you serious?
Monica: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my
life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's
when I came up with the baby plan. 
Ross: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that
guy's name? Dad!
Monica: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if
I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just
stupid.
Chandler: That, that's what's stupid.
Monica: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And
there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Rachel: Down at the docks again?
[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Janice and him are cuddling]
Janice: Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Chandler: Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at
all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird
though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!
Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay,
time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!
And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Malcom is giving Phoebe all of his spy stuff]
Malcom: Here's my binoculars.
Phoebe: Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going
strong. Keep going.
Malcom: These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)
Malcom: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here
something from it?
Phoebe: Um, not even a little bit.
Malcom: It's about you.
Phoebe: Oh, okay then.
Malcom: (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm
such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird,
but kinda cool.
Phoebe: Good. So what were you thinking?
Malcom: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Phoebe: Really?
Malcom: No.
Phoebe: Oh.
Malcom: See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Phoebe: Oh, okay. (he kisses her)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating jam straight out of the jar, and Chandler
is staring at him in amazement. Joey offers him some.]
Chandler: No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on
down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Chandler: You mean there's more than one of us.
Ross: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,
I'm, I'm gonna.....
Monica: You're gonna what?
Ross: I'm gonna tell Mom.
Rachel: Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Ross: Crazy.
Monica: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to
something....
Ross: (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Monica: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so
ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Joey: Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Monica: Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor,
born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn
and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Joey: Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Monica: Joey, this is you!
Joey: Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.
Rachel: When did you go to a sperm bank?
Joey: Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,
Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Chandler: And that's how you bought it?
Joey: Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised
there's any of my boys left.
Monica: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket
scientist here.
Joey: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'
on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Phoebe: (entering) Hellooo!
All: Hey.
Ross: How's the maniac?
Phoebe: Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Rachel: Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe: Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He
quit for me.
Rachel: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how
long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Phoebe: Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Ross: You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Phoebe: What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following
her?
Chandler: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Phoebe: What are you saying I should do?
Monica: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Phoebe: Thank you, Monica.
Joey: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Monica: Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
[Scene: Central Perk]
Rachel: Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)
Janice: Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Rachel: Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Janice: Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll
thing. 
Rachel: (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?
Janice: You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh...
my....God.
[Scene: Subway station, Phoebe is following Malcom by finding behind the pillars until
she comes up to one with a wire mesh garbage can next to it. Malcom stops and starts
walking the other way and passes Phoebe, who quick tries to hide behind the garbage can.
But, Malcom sees her.]
Malcom: Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yes? Yes! Oh.
Malcom: What are you doing?
Phoebe: Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich.
Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)
Malcom: Were you following me?
Phoebe: Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you
were still hung up on my sister.
Malcom: So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walks
past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)
Phoebe: Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just
walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you
know she takes this train?
Malcom: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Phoebe: No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I
made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause
your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be
like an Ursula patch.
Malcom: Uh-huh, I don't know.
Phoebe: Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the
pillar, which way am I gonna go? 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering]
Joey: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Joey: Where you going?
Monica: To the bank.
Joey: Sperm or regular?
Monica: Sperm.
Joey: So you're really doing this, huh?
Monica: Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. 
Joey: Sounds nice.
Monica: 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Joey: No kiddin', hmm. 
Monica: What?
Joey: No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Monica: Really? Why?
Joey: I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,
smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Monica: Hoyt?
Joey: It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big
pool.
Monica: Really, is he a swimmer?
Joey: He's got the body for it.
Monica: I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?
Joey: You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Monica: We do not have one of those signs.
Joey: Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great
kids.
Monica: Two girls and a boy?
Joey: Yeah!
Monica: And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,
they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of
them.
Joey: Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good
too. 
Monica: Yeah.
Joey: Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops
hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for
like a day. (hugs her again).
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is finishing off the last of the jam]
Joey: I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of
Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of
the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if
they met me in person.
Rachel: Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)
Joey: (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: (entering) Hello. 
Rachel: Hello.
Ross: (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I
talk to you for a second?
Chandler: Sure. What's up?
Ross: Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your
already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)

End[Scene: Monica and Rachel's: everyone is there and they are watching an
info-mercial that stars Joey.]
Host: Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Phoebe: Oh, oh! It's on again!
Joey: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
All: Shhhh!
Host: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get
a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and
these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Joey: (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the
counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Mike: And there is Kevin.
Joey: Can we please turn this off?
Rachel: Noo way, Kevin.
Mike: There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never
have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Ross: (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?
Chandler: You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Mike: Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how
easy this is to do. (to Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout
that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works
with any milk carton.
Joey: (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.
(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
(They all start laughing at him)
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Janice are sitting on the couch, and Phoebe is
sitting next to them in the chair.]
Chandler: Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Janice: Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean
back into Monica.)
Monica: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the
couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey.
Chandler: Hey, man. What's up?
Joey: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at
the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?!
Chandler: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Phoebe: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was
me! 
Joey: How is it you?
Phoebe: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was
in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him
her hand)
Joey: Yep, that's my audition.
Monica: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Phoebe: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Janice: What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Joey: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed
my chance.
Phoebe: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Joey: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,
she only talks to agents.
Phoebe: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing). 
Joey: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Phoebe: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)
'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,
she'll know what it's about.'
Joey: Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he
tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)
Phoebe: (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,
apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't
know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Chandler: Is anybody else scared?
Phoebe: (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is
it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to
Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she
tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)
Chandler: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Monica: Oh, now you want a pad.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are dropping off Ben]
Carol and Susan: (entering) Hey!!
Ross: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a
Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Carol: He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Susan: He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski
boots and a kicky beret.
Ross: Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Susan: So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and
be in show business.
Carol: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by
two women, does it?
Ross: You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so
am I.
(cut to later in the day)
Ross: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi.
Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck
sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)
Rachel: Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left
boob?
Joey: I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)
Monica: There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Joey: I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Chandler: (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Joey: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.
Go get me a sweater.
Chandler: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see
her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Rachel: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Chandler: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her
chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Ross: And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Chandler: Noo.
Ross: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to
you.
Chandler: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm
started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Rachel: Men are unbelievable.
Monica: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel
something, you have to run away?
Chandler: I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of
thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say
something stupid.
Monica: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until
you get us to break up with you.
Joey: Hey, you know about that?!
Chandler: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of
the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! 
(Joey looks quizzically at Ross)
Ross: (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.
Chandler: Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we
have any thoughts here?
Joey: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand
it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it
seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear
of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the
most committed guy there ever was.
Rachel: Amazingly, that makes sense.
Chandler: You think?
Joey: Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of
the gun, pee into the wind!
Chandler: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm
pretty much peeing every which way.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe's beeper is going off]
Phoebe: Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Rachel: Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and
pretend agents.
Joey: Come on baby, come on!
Phoebe: (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a
page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Rachel: Very nice touch.
Phoebe: (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi
Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work
for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify
yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to
have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a
tunnel.
Rachel: Unbelievable.
Joey: Thank you so much.
Phoebe: It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Joey: You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's
this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Phoebe: Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Joey: Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Phoebe: Two?
Joey: Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love
you.
Phoebe: Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Joey: Nooo, four.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Janice are having dinner]
Janice: So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Chandler: 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)
Janice: Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know
what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Chandler: Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into
your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Janice: Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Chandler: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what
girlfriends should, should get. 
Janice: Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought
that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Chandler: Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's
more. We should take a trip.
Janice: We should?
Chandler: Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your
parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Janice: (laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right
now! Are you okay?
Chandler: I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have
feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably
say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Janice: You probably want us to move in together?
Chandler: It doesn't scare me!
Janice: Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You
know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about
moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a
little late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)
Chandler: Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm
hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice
to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna
apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are comforting Chandler]
Rachel: Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)
Chandler: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going
to fast and we have to slow down.
Rachel and Monica: Uff.
Monica: That is never good.
Chandler: Then I got all needy and clingy.
Rachel: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so
bad. How did you leave it?
Chandler: She said she'd call me.
Rachel and Monica: Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)
Chandler: Oh God.
Monica: Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Chandler: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Rachel: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we
save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Monica: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch
to low-fat.
Rachel: Yeah, you do.
Chandler: So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Monica: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some
damage control.
Chandler: Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Rachel and Monica: Nooo!
Rachel: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching
for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want
her back you have to start acting aloof.
Monica: She has to know that your not ready.
Rachel: Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose. And then act aloof.
Chandler: So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Rachel: Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Chandler: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Rachel: Oh.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is still trying to get Ben to play with something
other than the Barbi doll.]
Ross: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A
real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Rachel: G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Joey: (entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Ross: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Joey and Ross: Go Joe!!!
Phoebe: (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)
Joey: Pheebs! There you are!
Phoebe: No it's not, sorry.
Joey: But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)
Phoebe: Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in
those....pants.
Joey: Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I
got a shot at it.
Phoebe: Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Joey: It's okay, these things happen.
Phoebe: But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,
terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Joey: I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)
Phoebe: Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,
okay, I just quit.
Joey: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,
rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Phoebe: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent.
Joey: They actually said that?
Phoebe: Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Joey: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You
know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in
a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.
Phoebe: Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Ross: (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he
then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's
door, dead.)
[Scene: A grocery store that Janice shops in. Chandler is on purpose, accidentally
bumping into her.]
Janice: (to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him)
Chandler!
Chandler: (in a British accent) Hello, Janice.
Janice: What are you doing here?
Chandler: (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Janice: Are you being British?!
Chandler: (normal voice) No. Not anymore.
Janice: Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you
here waiting for me?
Chandler: Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a
party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
Janice: Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Chandler: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Janice: Where is this party?
Chandler: Here in Chelsea.
Janice: Who's party is it?
Chandler: A woman's
Janice: What woman?!
Chandler: (shyly) Chelsea.
Janice: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're
seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or,
else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that
I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do
you want to be? (another guy walks by)
Chandler: Can I be that guy?
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are there]
Phoebe: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. 
Joey: Okay, shoot.
Phoebe: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
Joey: I didn't get it?
Phoebe: No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can
work on that. 
Joey: Okay, what else?
Phoebe: Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Joey: Oh.
Phoebe: Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Joey: Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this
Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Phoebe: Oh.
Joey: Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at
least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Phoebe: Yeah, no, I understand.
Joey: You do, thanks.
Phoebe: Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)
Joey: Wait a minute.
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of
being my agent.
Phoebe: (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
Joey: (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is laying on the counter and Rachel and Monica
are comforting him again.]
Chandler: ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran
out of the store.
Monica: My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Chandler: I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream
now, right?
Rachel: Yeah, it is.
Monica: You know what, everything's gonna be okay. 
(phone rings)
Chandler: (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?
Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?
Rachel: Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Monica: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Rachel: Yeah.
Chandler: Hello!
Monica: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke
up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Rachel: Yes, and grumpy.
Chandler: What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm
so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just
because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a
couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!
Rachel: He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody
else by now.
Chandler: (on phone) I love you too.
Monica: Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are picking up Ben, while Monica is
pouring chocolate syrup, lots of it, into her ice cream.]
Carol: G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Ross: Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Susan: What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Ross: Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't
deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Monica: What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You
used to dress up like a woman.
Ross: What?
Monica: Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Ross: What are you talking about?
Monica: The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Ross: Okay, you are totally making this up.
Monica: How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. 
Ross: (remembering) Oh God.
Susan: I've literally never been this happy.
Monica: Wasn't there a little song?
Carol: Oh please God, let there be a song.
Ross: There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!
Monica: (singing) 'I am Bea.'
Ross: Okay.
Monica: 'I drink tea.'
Ross: Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)
Monica: '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Ross: (coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. 
Monica: A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)
Closing Credits
[Scene: It's an old home movie of the Geller's backyard, young Ross is dressed up as
Bea, and pouring himself/herself some tea.]
Young Ross: (singing) 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance
around with....' (spills some tea and it drips onto his/her dress) Ohhh! (runs away
crying)
Young Monica: (entering the shot) Ross!!! (starts to wipe up
the spill)

End[Scene: Chandler and Joey’s, there is lumber all over the apartment]
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Joey: No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
Chandler: Yeah!
Joey: Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next
step.
Chandler: You’re building a post office?
Joey: No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a
one day job, max.
Chandler: Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!
Those are snug.
Joey: Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.
(Chandler goes to his bedroom and opens the door. However, only the top half opens, and
he trips into his bedroom over the bottom half.)
Joey: Power saw kinda got away from me there.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is pacing back and forth waiting for someone.]
Rachel: (joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs. 
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Any sign of your brother?
Phoebe: No, but he’s always late.
Rachel: I thought you only met him once?
Phoebe: Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know,
‘Frank’s always late.’
Rachel: Well relax, he’ll be here.
Phoebe: No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know
Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately.
It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.
You’re so sweet to wait with me.
Rachel: Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out
here, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)
[Scene: inside Central Perk]
Chandler: Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Monica: No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Chandler: All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put
him on her freebie list.
Joey: Her what?
Chandler: Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that
we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.
Ross: Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex
with celebrities.
Monica: So, Chandler, who’s on your list?
Chandler: Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,
Jessica Rabbit.
Rachel: Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your
league?
Chandler: I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop
out of her head.
Joey: Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Monica: First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Joey: It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ face
to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?
Rachel: Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy,
Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Ross: Spiderman?
Rachel: Hardy Boy.
Chandler: Peter Parker.
Ross: Thank you.
Rachel: What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Ross: Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First,
I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Chandler: (coughing) What a geek!
Phoebe: (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
All: Oh, hi.
Phoebe: This is everybody. This is Ross.
Frank: How are you?
Ross: Hey.
Phoebe: Chandler.
Chandler: Hi.
Frank: Hi.
Phoebe: Joey.
Joey: Hey-hey!
Frank: Hey.
Phoebe: This is Monica.
Frank: Whoa!
Phoebe: And this is Rachel.
Rachel: Hi!
Frank: Whoa!!
Phoebe: I’m gonna get coffee.
Frank: Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Chandler: We don’t, really.
Rachel: Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Phoebe: Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, and
everything.
Frank: Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick
up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a
hooker.
Chandler: You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.
Joey: I know.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey’s, Joey is drilling a hole in the wall and the drill
comes out the other side really close to Chandler’s head. Chandler then rushes out to
talk to Joey.]
Joey: Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?
Chandler: No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get
me, you kill me!!
Joey: Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Chandler: I do NOT want this unit!!
Joey: Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader.
Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.
Chandler: Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom
half of the door.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Joey is entering]
Monica: Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?
Joey: Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those
designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Monica: Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?
Joey: Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.
Monica: I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
Joey: Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to
be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.
Monica: I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Joey: Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes
right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in
his tight pants.)
Monica: That’s a little more than I wanted to see.
Joey: (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of
this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should
just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)
Monica: I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
(Joey places the toliet brush and holder over the hole, which is in the middle of the
floor.)
Joey: Eh! There you go.
Monica: You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon!
[Scene: Phoebe’s, Frank and her, are sitting on the counh, watching TV]
Phoebe: (sits up) Oh, ew!
Frank: What?
Phoebe: Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was
something I got from our Dad.
Frank: What, wait, you mean like this? (does it)
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can’t)
Frank: Your not doing it.
Phoebe: Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have
that....
Frank: When’s your birthday?
Phoebe: Feburary 16th.
Frank: I know a guy who’s the 18th.
Phoebe: Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?
Frank: October 25th.
Phoebe: That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda
things do you like to do at home?
Frank: Melt stuff.
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is working on his list]
Ross: Okay, I’ve got three of my five.
Rachel: Three of your five, what?
Ross: Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.
Rachel: Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Ross: Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Chandler: All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Ross: Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Chandler: Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Ross: Susan Sarandon.
Chandler: Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t
let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Ross: And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Chandler: Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too
international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.
Rachel: So?
Chandler: So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the
country like all the time.
Rachel: Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini,
geography.
[Scene: Phoebe’s, Frank is melting a plastic spoon.]
Phoebe: Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Frank: Yeah.
Phoebe: So is it like art?
Frank: Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Phoebe: Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Frank: No, I wanna melt it.
Phoebe: Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I
think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Frank: (starts laughing) Yeah!
Phoebe: G’night, bro.
Frank: G’night.
Phoebe: Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.
Frank: Oh, excellent. (starts to melt the fire extinguisher’s hose.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Phoebe is eating breakfast with Monica while Frank is
playing with num-chucks on the balcony]
Monica: What kind of karate is that?
Phoebe: No kind. He just makes it up.
Monica: So how’s it going with you guys?
Phoebe: So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that
he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and
connected and....
Monica: Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the
years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe
shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually
goes over your head. 
Phoebe: Ah!!
Monica: Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Phoebe: Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Monica: Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Phoebe: I just asked you.
Monica: I just asked you.
Phoebe: I don’t have time for this.
Monica: No, that is what the game is.
Phoebe: Which you just gave up really quickly.
Chandler: (entering) Have you seen Joey?
Monica: What’s the matter?
Chandler: Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of
his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where
we keep the varnish.
Joey: (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those
tiles.
Chandler: What’s going on?
Monica: He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
Chandler: Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Monica: Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Chandler: He started mine first!
Phoebe: Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
[Scene: Phoebe’s, Phoebe and Frank are watching TV.]
Frank: Whoa! Big octopus.
Phoebe: Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) ‘Hello. (listens) Oh my
God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can’t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have
company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that’s all right I’ll come in.’ (hangs up
phone) Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one
of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.
Frank: Hey, what kind of work do you do?
Phoebe: Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Frank: You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
Phoebe: Well, y'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!
Frank: (starts laughing) Wow! That’s wild! No, I had no idea.
Phoebe: All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come
with me?
Frank: You mean like watch?
Phoebe: No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know
what are big sisters for?
Frank: Well, I don’t think this, y'know.
Phoebe: No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun!
Hey! Are you excited?
Frank: Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s bathroom, Joey and Monica are admiring the new floor.]
Monica: It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever
was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Chandler: What, like a number?
Ross: (entering) Hey! 
Chandler: Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
Ross: Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little
card)
Rachel: Well, it’s about time.
Joey: Ooh, very official.
Ross: Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Monica: And who laminated it?
Ross: That would be me.
Rachel: All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? 
Ross: Hey, it’s my list.
Rachel: Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
[Scene: Healing Hands Inc. (Phoebe’s work), Frank is being ushered in, by the arm,
to the room Phoebe is in by another girl.]
Frank: Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Phoebe: Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?
Frank: She broke my arm.
Girl: He touched my fanny.
Frank: No, she touched mine first!
Girl: That’s my job!
Frank: So wait, what’s the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I
can’t touch you?
Phoebe and Girl: Ewww!!!
Phoebe: You can’t have sex with her!
Girl: What’d you think I was, a hooker?
Frank: No, your a masseuse, it’s cool, I’m not a cop.
Phoebe: Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like
five minutes.
Jasmine: Fine. (starts to leave, and points at Frank) I don’t like you!!
(leaves)
Phoebe: (turns around and hits Frank) So that’s what you thought I did!!
God! That’s not what I do!
Frank: Wait that’s-that’s, what that’s not what you do?
Phoebe: Nooo! Why would you think that?
Frank: I don’t know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I
mean, I don’t know.
Phoebe: Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Frank: Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can’t believe that
I screwed it up so bad.
Phoebe: You really thought it was perfect?
Frank: Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was pretty
cool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Phoebe: Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Frank: Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my
likes and my dislikes...
Phoebe: I don’t....
Frank: How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn’t
melt.
Phoebe: Right, okay, um-mm.
Frank: Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you ‘cause y'know
you’re my sister, y'know.
Phoebe: Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Frank: Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Phoebe: Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.
Frank: You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
Phoebe: Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now,
this.
Frank: This?
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Frank: Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I
almost got arm broken by a hooker...
Phoebe: She wasn’t a hooker.
Frank: Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. 
[Scene: Chandler and Joey’s, everyone is there, helping to lift the entertainment
center into place]
Chandler: Okay, on three. One....Two....
Joey: Why don’t we just go on two.
Chandler: Why two?
Joey: Because it’s faster.
Chandler: Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this
‘two’ talk.
Rachel: Oh!
Joey: All right, but in the future...
Ross: Okay!! Okay!!
Rachel: Come on!
Ross: Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Chandler: Okay, one...two...
Joey: So we are going on two?
All: All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem,
the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)
Chandler: Oh, good job Joe.
Joey: Wow, it’s big!
Chandler: Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! 
Joey: Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.
Phoebe: Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Joey: Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a
little of my door.
Chandler: Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks
none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move
it, but it doesn’t move.)
Joey: Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is serving some guy coffee.]
Rachel: Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,
double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy
nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.
(Isabella Rosselini enters)
Ross: (to Gunther) Thank you.
Isabella: (to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please.
(Ross recognises her and goes over to the couch, mouthing ‘Oh my God’
Ross: Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)
Monica: Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.
Ross: Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.
Monica: Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?
Ross: Yeah, maybe.
Rachel: Oh-oh, you lie.
Ross: What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
Rachel: Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Ross: Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Rachel: You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.
Ross: Okay, hold my crawler.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Rachel: Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just
sorry we don’t got popcorn.
Ross: (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m
a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I
could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you
for that one? 
Isabella: Aren’t you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who
waves back)
Ross: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding,
um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed
to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.
Isabella: I’m sorry. (starts to leave)
Ross: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss
this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Isabella: Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Ross: Um, yeah.
Isabella: May I see it?
Ross: Um, no.
Isabella: Come on! (grabs the list)
Ross: But, okay.
Isabella: (reading it) I’m not on the list!
Ross: Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.
Isabella: It’s laminated!
Ross: Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler
(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped
you for Wynona Rider, local.
Isabella: Y'know it’s ironic...
Ross: What?
Isabella: ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday
I bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)
Ross: (to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Chandler and Joey’s, they are admiring the entertainment center]
Joey: Y'know what?
Chandler: Umm?
Joey: I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
Chandler: I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
Joey: Get out your checkbook, mister.
Chandler: Oh, I think I have the cash.
(Joey successfully enters the entertainment center, and Chandler closes the door on
Joey.)
Joey: You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Chandler: Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so
that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack
between the door and frame) Here you go.
Joey: Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.
Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks
are on me!

End{Transcriber's Note: Rachel has two friends that are not named, so I referred to them
as Friend No. 1 and Friend No. 2.}



[Scene: Central Perk, the whole gang is there including Janice.]
Janice: Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of
you?
Phoebe: Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.
Ross: I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Janice: Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Joey: Well, that’s really a different question.
Janice: I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who
spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Joey: Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Monica and Rachel: What?!!
Rachel: Excuse me, there was no time!
Joey: Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?
Janice: Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Rachel: Does anybody need more coffee?
Ross: Yeah, I’ll take some.
Joey: Hey, there’s a dog out there!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe’s, three years earlier, Phoebe, Monica, and Ross are
there]
Phoebe: Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Ross: What?
Phoebe: Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Monica: (entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh,
Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Phoebe: You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Monica: Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. (leaves)
Phoebe: (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That’s why I moved out.
Ross: Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister
that you don’t live here anymore.
Phoebe: I think on some levels she already knows.
Ross: Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she
doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that
you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
Phoebe: Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
Chandler: (entering, with a goatee) Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Chandler: I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Phoebe: Why, nobody good?
Chandler: Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s
plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need
to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing!
Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Ross: So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Chandler: Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,
who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone
‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’
Monica: (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the
floor or come over no more!
Ross: (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Monica: What?
Ross: I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Chandler: Umm, how’s it going with you guys?
Ross: Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were
having so much trouble lately.
Phoebe: Oh, really?
Ross: Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any
close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan
something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference
[Scene: Chandler’s, Chandler is interviewing a potential roommate.]
Chandler: Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Eric: Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope
that’s cool.
Chandler: Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Eric: Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s
beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell
you, she’s a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)
Chandler: Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless
it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers
to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)
[Scene: Chandler’s, Chandler is interviewing Joey.]
Chandler: (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.
Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)
Bye-bye.
Joey: Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?
Chandler: Sure. Ummm. What’s up?
Joey: Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.
Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.
Chandler: What gay thing?
Joey: Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool
with that.
[Scene: the hallway, Monica is coming up the stairs.]
Chandler: Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.

Joey: Hey!
(Joey leaves and Monica mouths to Chandler ‘Oh my God!’)
[Scene: A bar, Chandler is entering.]
Chandler: Hey, Mon.
Monica: Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Chandler: Do I ever.
Monica: Chris says they’re closing down the bar.
Chandler: No way!
Monica: Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Chandler: Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Monica: Got me.
Chandler: (to bartender) Can I get a beer.
Monica: Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Chandler: You betcha!
Monica: Is it the Italian guy?
Chandler: Um-mm, yeah right!
Monica: He’s so cute.
Chandler: Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around
with and be referred to as the funny one.
Monica: Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back
in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Chandler: Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.
Rachel: (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no,
no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I
ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.
Waitress: I am so sorry.
Rachel: That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a
couple drinks right, huh?
Friend No. 1: Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one
year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Rachel: Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out
and they all scream)
Friend No. 2: Oh, isn’t it exciting, I mean it’s like having a
boyfriend for life.
Rachel: Yeah, I know.
Friend No. 1: What?
Rachel: Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for
the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,
y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)
Friend No. 1: Rachel stop!
Friend No. 2: You’re so bad!
Rachel: I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have
some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
(Chandler throws the cue ball under there table.)
Chandler: Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Rachel: Yeah, so?
Chandler: (picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to
Monica.)
Monica: Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!
Rachel: Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)
Monica: Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.
Rachel: Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much.
Monica: Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Rachel: Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Monica: Aww, not right now.
Rachel: Oh, but that’s okay.
Monica: I know.
Rachel: Yeah.
(An awkward silence)
Monica: So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the
cue ball as a ‘Remember me?’ thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next
time I’m in the city?
Monica: Oh, that’d be great.
Rachel: Okay!
Monica: Thanks.
Rachel: Bye!
Monica: Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my
life.
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe’s, Ross is on the phone, as Phoebe is walking by
carrying a lamp.]
Ross: No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,
no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Phoebe: So what are they doing?
Ross: I don’t know, something girlie.
Phoebe: (to Monica, who’s entering) Hey, you’re early.
Monica: What are you doing with the lamp?
Phoebe: I’m just taking it to be re-wired.
Monica: Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo,
‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.
(There is a knock on the door, Phoebe answers it, its Mr. Heckles)
Phoebe: No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Mr. Heckles: You’re disturbing my oboe practice.
Phoebe: You don’t play the oboe!
Mr. Heckles: I could play the oboe!
Phoebe: Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in
his face.)
(in the hallway, Eric is moving in)
Mr. Heckles: (to Eric) Who are you?
Eric: Hi, I’m Eric, I’m gonna be Chandler’s new roommate.
Mr. Heckles: I’m Chandler’s new roommate.
Eric: I-I-I don’t think so.
Mr. Heckles: I could be Chandler’s new roommate.
Eric: But, he told me over the phone.
Mr. Heckles: He told me in person.
Eric: That’s weird.
Mr. Heckles: Well, I’m going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to
the door and opens it) Ehh! (Eric leaves)
(inside Chandler’s apartment, Chandler is coming in from his bedroom, sees Mr.
Heckles, and screams.)
[Scene: the hallway, Joey is moving in, Monica is leaving.]
Monica: Hi, again.
Joey: Hey! (goes into the apartment)
Chandler: (leaving to go to work) Hey!
Monica: Thank you soo, much.
Chandler: Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I
gotta get to get to work.
(Joey comes back into the hallway and starts to pick up a heavy box)
Monica: You want some help with that?
Joey: Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!
Monica: Whoa! Are you okay?
Joey: Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Monica: It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)
And-and the humidity.
Joey: That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.
Monica: Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Joey: Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is
a great place.
Monica: Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Joey: Gotcha.
Monica: This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all
of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her
when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the
landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you
thirsty?
Joey: Oh, you bet I am!
Monica: (turning around) Okay, here’s your penis!
Commercial Break
[Scene: continued from earlier.]
Monica: Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Joey: You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Monica: So?!
Joey: Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Monica: Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Joey: Oh right, right.
Monica: I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to
you that means they wanna have sex?
Joey: Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.
Monica: It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,
but... By the way I can still see it.
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe’s, Monica is vacuuming.]
Monica: Pheebs?
Phoebe: Huh?
Monica: Where’s your bed?
Phoebe: It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’
look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here
anymore.
Monica: What are you talking about?
Phoebe: I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t
know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Monica: Everybody knows!
Phoebe: That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,
I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got
like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. 
Monica: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Phoebe: Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other
side.
Monica: What?!?!
Phoebe: Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a
land where people can spill.
Monica: You can spill. In the sink.
Phoebe: Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I
love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that
happening.
Monica: I love you, too. 
Phoebe: Aww, good. (they hug) What?
Monica: What? I’m just said.
Phoebe: No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, (now) Joey is watching Baywatch, as Chandler enters
from his bedroom.]
Chandler: So ah, whatcha watching?
Joey: Baywatch.
Chandler: What’s it about?
Joey: Lifeguards.
Chandler: Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?
Joey: Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
(Baywatch goes into one of those running scenes.)
Chandler: Wow! Look at them run.
Joey: They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Chandler: Yeah, I’ll go get one.
Joey: No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.
[Scene: Monica’s, Monica is coming out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a
towel, as Chandler is entering.]
Chandler: Well, hello!
Monica: Hey.
Chandler: Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.
Monica: (all depressed) Help yourself.
Chandler: You okay?
Monica: Phoebe moved out.
Chandler: Right.
Monica: I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I
don’t have a boyfriend?
Chandler: Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I
don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Monica: Well, I think so.
Chandler: Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my
favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.
[Scene: the bar, Ross is entering, Phoebe is at the bar, they are the only two in the
place.]
Ross: (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
Phoebe: Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is
wrong?
Ross: My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Phoebe: Oh no! Why?
Ross: ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m
not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
Phoebe: Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Ross: (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many
drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and
she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look
at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!
Phoebe: Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Ross: Well, now I do!!
Phoebe: I’m sorry.
Ross: Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the
only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....
Phoebe: Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)
[Scene: Monica’s, Chandler and Monica are still hugging each other.]
Chandler: Umm, this is nice.
Monica: I know, it is isn’t it?
Chandler: No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Monica: Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Chandler: Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle
a nuclear device.
Monica: Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Chandler: Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,
it’s, it’s gonna be....
Monica: I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)
[Scene: the bar, Phoebe is still hugging Ross.]
Ross: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or
I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
Phoebe: I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.
You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)
Ross: Thanks.
Phoebe: And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And
you’re kind (kisses him on the lips)
Ross: Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
(They pause, and they the start kissing passionately, and taking off each others
clothes, and they start to lie down on the pool table.)
Ross: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Phoebe: Huh?
(Ross tries to clear off the pool table by knocking the balls to the other end of the
table, but they all bounce back, and he frantically starts to throw them into the
pockets.)
Phoebe: Okay, it’s okay.
(Phoebe jumps on to the table and lays down, Ross follows her and hits his head on the
light hanging over the pool table.)
Phoebe: Oh. (they start kissing again)
Ross: Wait, wait, wait.
Phoebe: What?
Ross: My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Phoebe: What?
Ross: No, I can’t get it out.
Phoebe: Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.
Ross: No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
Phoebe: What?
Ross: Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
(They both look at each other and start laughing (Lisa almost lost it there), and sit
up. Ross hits his head on the lamp again.)
Ross: Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
Phoebe: You have chalk on your face.
Ross: Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
Phoebe: Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this
was real grass.
Monica: Hey, are you okay?
Ross: My wife’s a lesbian.
Joey: Cool!!
Chandler: Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)
Ross: Hi.
Closing Credits
[Scene: the bar, Chandler is playing pool, as Rachel enters.]
Chandler: I can’t believe you came back.
Rachel: Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna
think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
(She hits the jukebox Fonzy style, and It’s That Time of Season starts to
play, as they start to kiss.)

Rachel: Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 
Chandler: I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
(Phoebe takes a bite and spits it out and screams.)
Chandler: Okay, I’m not gonna have one.
Ross: Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
Phoebe: No, no, it’s just my tooth.
Chandler: All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)
Ross: So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.
Phoebe: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.
Chandler: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Ross: Why? Why can’t you go to him?
Phoebe: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Chandler: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down
the hygienist’s blouse.
Rachel: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,
my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.
Rachel: And all these people actually died?
Phoebe: Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of
my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Ross: Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened
to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a
coincidence.
Phoebe: Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.

Phoebe: (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
Rachel: Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.

not.
Monica: You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Ross: What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going
to tell Chandler?
Joey: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to
not.
Rachel: Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you
have to tell him.
Joey: It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.
Phoebe: Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll
kill him.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, All are there except for Chandler.]

look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,
or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all
that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
Ross: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids
messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Joey: What did they do?
Ross: Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then
they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.
Monica: So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Ross: Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.
Rachel: Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Ross: You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths
‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d
be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica
sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)
Joey: Hey-hey, Ross?
Ross: Yeah.
Joey: I’ve got a science question.
Ross: Hmm?
Joey: If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why
there extinct?
Ross: Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Joey: Hey-hey, I’m not judging.

Ben’s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)

him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good boy. (to Monica)
How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Monica: He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.
Rachel: We’re not?!
Monica: No we’re not.
Rachel: All right, I like that. 
Monica: Okay.

Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump,

Rachel: I cannot push it in!
Monica: Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay.
Monica: I got it!

your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
Rachel: Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Monica: A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Rachel: We need a hat..
Monica: Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Rachel: Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)
Monica: Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a
bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, you’re a genius!
Rachel: Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.
Monica: Give it. Give it.
Rachel: Okay.
(Monica takes the bear, grabs his hat, and rips off his head.)
Monica and Rachel: Oh!!
Rachel: Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.

speacial. Come in here with me.
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something
speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Chandler: That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba
birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.
Joey: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get
her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Chandler: All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me
anything ever. (starts to go into the store)

(Janice starts to breath into it and sucks in the reciept, and then spits it out.)
Janice: The receipt.
Chandler: I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with

head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay,

bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!

Rachel: I also said number one.
Joey: I know. (giggles harder)
Ross: (entering) Hey! Everyone.
Rachel: Hi!

Ben: Monica.
Ross: Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.
Ben: Monica bang!
Monica: Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I
exploded.
Phoebe: Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is
alive.
Joey: Uh.
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
[Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy.]
Phoebe: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting
stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Rachel: Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.
Joey: I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.
Monica: All right, we should call somebody.
Ross: And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t
moving.
Rachel: Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.
Monica: How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.
Joey: Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters.]
Joey: Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when
we get Chinese food?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Well, now we got a reason.
Chandler: What?
Joey: Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.
Chandler: All right.
Joey: Hey uh, what’s a matter?
Chandler: I talked to Janice.
Joey: Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Chandler: She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this
morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that
twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the
reciept!
Joey: What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Chandler: I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Joey: Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.
Chandler: Come on, tell me.
Joey: All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it
was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I
would bow out.
Chandler: What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey
quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?
Joey: They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a
family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I
wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna
ah, come poke a nude guy?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is
entering from Rachel’s room.]
Ross: Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Rachel: Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no
offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Ross: It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,
y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Rachel: (confidently) I did!
Ross: I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.
Rachel: I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against
that thing!
Ross: Monica did it?
(Monica runs into the kitchen from the terrace.)
Ross: Monica?
Monica: Yeah.
Ross: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Monica: No. Why?
Ross: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet
song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’
and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.
Monica: Really?!
Ross: Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left
leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of
y'know... (walks around in a circle) 
Monica: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)
Rachel: I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.
Monica: (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
(starts to chase Ross around the living room)
Ross: Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
Rachel: I’ll get the hat.
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Janice are there.]
Chandler: Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me
get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.
Janice: Okay.
Chandler: I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy
that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are
the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter
how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Janice: Wow!
Chandler: Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.
Janice: Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say
‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way
I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been
singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my
soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our
lives together.
Chandler: Then don’t leave me!
Janice: What?
Chandler: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Janice: No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my
marriage another chance.
Chandler: No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance.
Janice: (standing up) I’m sorry. (hugs him)
Chandler: Ohhh. Don’t go.
Janice: No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn’t
let her go.)
Chandler: No. No! No! No!
Janice: Honey, honey, people are looking.
Chandler: I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I
don’t care!!
Janice: Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of
Chandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)
Chandler: You can’t leave! I have your shoe!
Janice: Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)
Gunther: Rachel has those in burgendy.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the
giant poking device.]
Joey: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be
difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Ross: Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
Phoebe: I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a
dead fat guy on a stick.
Joey: All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance
the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.
Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their
view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the
needle. 
(They thread the needle and start poking him, he then stirs.)
Phoebe: He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!
Monica: And yet, we’re still poking him.
Joey: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Ross: He does not look happy.
Rachel: Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.
Joey: Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Closing Credits
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is listening to a Lionel Richie album]
Chandler: (singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe
enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....
Phoebe: (joining him) Love....
Chandler and Phoebe: I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I
don’t mind.
Chandler: (high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.
Chandler and Phoebe: Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Chandler: I know.
Phoebe: I know.
Chandler: I’ve found.
Phoebe: I’ve found....
Chandler and Phoebe: ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched,
Chandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless
love. (once again they don’t match tones, and they just look at each other)

End[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there, the guys are
watching football, the girls are cooking Thanksgiving dinner.]
The Guys: (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Phoebe: Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching
football, you could help.
The Guys: We will. (they don’t move)
Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Rachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want
to do this. 
(Rachel sticks a marshmellow into Monica’s nose. Monica takes it out of her nose
by closing one nostril, and blowing.)
Monica: Every year.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Phoebe: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these
things. (just as she sits down).
Ross: Halftime.
Joey: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little
three on three going?
Rachel: Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Phoebe: Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever. 
Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler.
Chandler: No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.
Joey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Chandler: That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut
clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I
don’t have goals!
Joey: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you
get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t
play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.
Chandler: Yeah, all right, I’ll play.
Phoebe: Yay!!
Rachel: Let’s do it! Ross?
Ross: What?
Rachel: Do you wanna play football?
Ross: Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.
Joey: Says who? Your mom?
Monica and Ross: Yeah.
Monica: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football
game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’
Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Monica: Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve
competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.
Ross: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she
threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Monica: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown
didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose
breaking.
Monica: (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
Rachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Ross: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,
‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy
and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it
in the lake.
Chandler: And was the curse lifted?
Ross: Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever
again.
Monica: Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s
been twelve years.
Ross: Can I see you for a second?
(they walk over to the sink and discuss it for a moment)
Monica: (shouting) Once!!
Ross: All right, we’re gonna play.
Chandler: But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because
my Mom won’t let me cross the street.
[Scene: The Park, the gang is warming up for their football game.]
Monica: Okay. Let’s bring it in.
Rachel: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Ross: Here you go. (throws her the ball)
Rachel: (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the
face.
Joey: All right, we have to pick captains.
Chandler: And then Tineals.
Phoebe: Okay, so how do we decide that?
Monica: Well, why don’t we just bunny up.
Rachel, Chandler, and Joey: What?
Monica and Ross: (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit
ears with their fingers.) Bunny!
Monica: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first
so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Joey: Thank you.
Rachel: Monica, I’m your best friend.
Ross: Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.
Rachel: Ross!
Monica: Phoebe.
(Phoebe kisses Rachel on the cheek, then joins her team.)
Ross: Sweetie, now I pick you.
Rachel: You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!
Ross: Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to
the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off.
Monica: All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes
before I have to baste again.
Chandler: Wow! Just like in the pros.
Monica: Huddle up.
Joey: (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.
Phoebe: Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Monica: Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Monica: Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Phoebe: What’s block?
Monica: Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?
Phoebe: I thought you meant in life.
Monica: Break.
(Chandler is getting ready to kick off, Ross is holding the ball between his foot and
finger.)
Chandler: The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but
kicks Ross’s foot instead.)
Ross: Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Chandler: Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.
(Chandler throws the ball to kick-off.)
Joey: I got it. (catches the ball)
Phoebe: Go! Go! Go!
(Joey runs up field and fakes out Ross and scores a touchdown. His team all celebrates
the touchdown.)
Monica: Score!! 7 to nothing!
Rachel: (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?
Ross: Come on, let’s go!
Monica: Losers walk!
Ross: Yeah, losers talk!
Chandler: No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
[cut to later, Ross’s team has the ball.]
Chandler: (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts
his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and
looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?
Ross: Yeah!
Chandler: (from the shotgun) Hike!
Monica and Joey: One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
(Rachel runs a quick slant.)
Rachel: Over here!
(Chandler throws her the ball, which she drops.)
Rachel: (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!
Chandler: Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Ross: Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the
right. Okay. Break!
Rachel: Wait, what am I gonna do?
Ross: You, you go long.
Rachel: Wait, how long?
Ross: Until we start to look very small.
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Break!!
[cut to later, Monica’s team has the ball.]
Joey: Set....hike!
Ross: One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Chandler: No, no, no, no, no!
(Monica throws the ball over Joey’s head, it’s stopped from rolling away by a
very beautiful woman.)
Joey: Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Woman: (in a foreign accent) You are playing American football?
Joey: Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Woman: I’m Dutch.
Joey: Hi-hi, I’m Joey.
Woman: I’m Margha.
Joey: I’m sorry Dutch, I didn’t get that last little bit.
Chandler: (running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees
Marhan) Hi, I’m Chandler.
Margha: Hello, Chandler.
Joey: Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Margha: Margha.
Joey: Mar-klan.
Margha: Mar-gha.
Chandler: Mar-haaaan.
[cut to Ross and Monica.]
Monica: Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down.
Ross: Uh, hello, it’s third down.
Monica: No it’s not, it’s second.
Ross: Wow!
Monica: Wow, what?
Ross: It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Monica: Pulling what? It’s second down.
Ross: Okay, it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you
need.
Monica: I heard that!
Ross: Well, I said it loud.
[cut to Chandler, Joey, and Margha.]
Margha: It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Chandler and Joey: Yeah! Why don’t you stick around. You can sit right
there.
(she goes and sits down)
Chandler: Well, that went well.
Joey: I think so.
Chandler: Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Joey: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it
myself, y'know.
Chandler: Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of
that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Joey: Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have
her.
Chandler: Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t
I wouldn’t have a shot?
Joey: Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad
man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.
Chandler: Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget
about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.
[cut to later, in Ross’s huddle.]
Ross: Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And
sweetie..
Rachel: Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing is
running back and forth from the huddle.
Ross: Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Rachel: Can I see that for second.
Ross: Yeah.
(Rachel takes the ball from his hands and bounces it off of Ross’s forehead and
Chandler catches the rebound.)
Ross: Okay. Hut! Hike!
(Chandler runs around behind Ross, who pitches him the ball. Chandler runs upfield, and
Joey knocks the ball out of his hands.)
Joey: Fumble!
(Joey starts to return the fumble and Chandler grabs Joey’s shirt and rips it off
of his back.)
Joey: What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Chandler: Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Joey: All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But
now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Chandler: Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or
something about you that’s mean!
Monica: All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’re
runnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica
throws the ball to Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Joey: Pheebs, run!
Monica: Run, Phoebe, run!
(Phoebe runs and scores a touchdown.)
Phoebe: Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
Ross: Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.
Monica: After the snap!
Ross: Before the snap!
Joey: After!!
Chandler: Before!!
Rachel: Now, does it really matter?
All: Yes!!
Phoebe: Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Ross: Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.
Monica: Does so count!
Ross: Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I
have.
Ross: Oh-ho, okay.
Monica: Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
Ross: Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go
ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Phoebe: Woo-yay!!
Monica: No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay.
Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the
fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and
it’s halftime.
Ross: Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!!
Monica: Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.
Ross: Oh really! Why is that?
[cut to Monica and Rachel’s.]
Monica: Because the winner gets this!
Ross: The Geller Cup.
Chandler: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
All: Yeah.
Chandler: Okay, good.
Commercial Break
[Scene: The park, the gang is returning to play the second half of the game.]
Ross: Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Monica: When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I
swam into the lake and fished it out.
Ross: That cup is mine!
Monica: No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!
Rachel: All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Monica: Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious,
huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
Joey: It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Monica: All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able
to focus?
Joey: What are you gonna do?
Monica: All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll
take care of the rest.
Joey: Okay.
Monica: Break!
Joey: Here you go!
(Joey throws the ball to Chandler)
Ross: Chandler! Chandler!
(Chandler catches the ball and starts to run upfield.)
Chandler: (to Margha) Hi.
(just as he gets in front of Margha, Monica comes up and tackles him)
Monica: Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do
ya?
Ross: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?
Monica: What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Ross: Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
(They both stare each other down as we hear ‘Let’s get ready to
r-r-r-rum-ble!!!’)
(A long football sequence follows.)
[Sequence 1: Monica throws the ball over Chandler’s head to Joey who catches it
for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration. Chandler then tackles him, and he
starts to dance in celebration.]
[Sequence 2: Monica runs upfield and stops, waiting for a pass. Ross runs over and
pulls her pants down, steps in front of her and intercepts the pass.]
[Sequence 3: Chandler throws a pass to Ross, who catches it. Phoebe starts screaming
and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. But all she ends up doing is running around
his waist and screaming.]
[Sequence 4: Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera pans down to show Rachel
standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. Something hits her on the head and
she looks up to see where it came from.]
[Sequence 5: Monica hands the ball off to Phoebe, who runs up field and delivers a
fore-arm shiver to Chandler, knocking him over and scores the touchdown, and she yells...]
Phoebe: I love this game!!
[cut to Ross who walks up to Rachel who is eating a baked pretzel.]
Ross: Hey, where’d you get that?
Rachel: I went really long.
Monica: Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Ross: It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick
first, so you got the better team.
Monica: You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re
winning because I’m better than you.
(Ross makes a ‘Yeah. Right.’ sound.)
Monica: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll
prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the
game.
Ross: What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica,
because I’m only down by three touchdowns.
Monica: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to
a bunch of girls.
Ross: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.
Rachel: I can not believe your trading me!!
Monica: Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a
winning team for a change.
Rachel: Are you gonna let me play?
Monica: All right then.
[cut to the guys’ team.]
Margha: (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?
Chandler: No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching
teams.
Joey: Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re
on the same team.
Ross: Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.
Chandler: No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Joey: Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Chandler: And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the
Netherlands, right?
Joey: Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Margha: Oh, my.
Ross: Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball,
guys.
Joey: Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now.
Chandler: Fine with me.
Ross: Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,
which of my boys do you like?
Chandler and Joey: What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 
Margha: Which do I like?
Ross: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your
windmill...
Margha: Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird,
I would have to say, Chandler.
Chandler: Yes!!
Joey: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the
question.
Chandler: Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Margha: I’m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
Chandler: You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I
win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
Margha: I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Chandler: Wh-what?
Margha: I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Joey: Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Chandler: Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me!
From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready,
Set, Cook!
Ross: Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no
time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Chandler: We’re not gonna lose to girls.
Ross: Hey! It’s 42-21!
Joey: This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Monica: Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
[cut to the girls huddle.]
Monica: We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just
think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while
you’re making out...
Phoebe: Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Monica: Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill
‘um!
Rachel: Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!
Phoebe: All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how
are we gonna beat three boys?
(Another football sequence follows)
[Sequence 1: Chandler is running past Phoebe with the ball, Phoebe flashes him, he
stops and stares dumbfounded at her. Phoebe then runs up and takes the ball away.]
[Sequence 2: Phoebe throws the ball, and it’s intercepted by Joey, who starts to
run up field. Rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she
doesn’t slow him down. Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop
Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.]
[Sequence 3: Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler
covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.]
[cut to the girls huddle]
Monica: All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down
by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a
slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Rachel: No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Monica: Honey, there’s a reason.
Rachel: God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you
let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Phoebe: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Monica: All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw
it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Rachel: Thank you! Break!
Monica: Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
(Phoebe snaps the ball to Monica, who pitches back to Rachel.)
The Guys: One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
(They all rush toward Rachel, who panics and runs away. She runs out of the park and up
along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past Monica, as she gets to
Monica, she throws the ball at Monica, and it hits her in the eye.)
Rachel: I’m so sorry! Are you okay?
Monica: No! I’m not okay!
Rachel: I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know
what to do.
Joey: (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Chandler: Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Monica: Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!
Phoebe: Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Monica: All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Rachel: (on the verge of tears) Okay.
Monica: Break!
(In slow motion, Phoebe snaps the ball, Rachel goes long. Joey and Chandler and all
over Phoebe, leaving Rachel wide open. Ross starts to rush Monica, who sees Phoebe is
double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel. We see flying through the air, and
then Rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then
Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock. Then with the grace of Jerry Rice (no
offense to Jerry Rice), Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. Both
Phoebe and Monica erupt in celebration.)
Rachel: (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Chandler: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at
that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!
Phoebe: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody
tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.
(they all start to dive for the ball and Monica and Ross grab it at the same time.)
Ross: Let go! Let go!
Monica: Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!
Chandler: Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important
who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not
you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Monica: Ow!!
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are eating Thanksgiving
dinner.]
Rachel: We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like
league we could join or something.
Phoebe: Isn’t there a national football league.
Chandler: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Rachel: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Phoebe: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Joey: When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.
[Scene: The park, it’s dark outside and Monica and Ross are still fighting over
the ball.]
Monica: Let go!
Ross: No! You let go!
Monica: No!
Ross: How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
Monica: I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.
(It starts snowing.)
Ross: Hey! It’s starting to snow.
(They both look up, and watch it start to snow. Then they both start fighting for the
ball again.)
Ross: Gimme the this!
Monica: Let go!
End[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are
there, Joey is demonstrating a card trick.]
Joey: Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize
it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Monica: Um-mm.
Joey: All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the
card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a
little while) 5 of hearts.
(Monica is sarcastically amazed.)
Ross: Real magic does exist.
Rachel: Wow.
Monica: Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?
Joey: I can’t tell you that, no.
(We hear some knocking coming from the ceiling.)
Ross: Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.
Rachel: Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Monica: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Phoebe: Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly,
please?’
Monica: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there
to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Phoebe: Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him
to keep it down.
Monica: All right, be my guest.
Rachel: Good luck.
(Phoebe exits)
Joey: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna
know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you
didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks
up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.
Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow
motion)
All: Oh, I got it.
(We hear Phoebe knock at the door upstairs, and the guy answer it.)
Phoebe: (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs
and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the
rest is unintelligible).
Guy: (muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Phoebe: (muffled) Oh, thank you.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Chandler: (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with
a little nouse at the end?
Monica: Honey, what’s the matter?
Chandler: I just saw Janice. 
All: Oh.
Chandler: Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she
looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.
Joey: Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke
up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed
me.
Chandler: Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Joey: Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Ross: Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.
Chandler: Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw
a party for me.
Monica: It’s Joey’s birthday.
Chandler: Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
(We hear Phoebe’s muffled voice through the ceiling.)
Monica: Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
(We hear the guy telling a joke, and Phoebe laughing.)
Chandler: Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s
supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
[Scene: Fortunata Fashions, Rachel’s new job.]
Mr. Kaplan: (entering) How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?
Rachel: (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Mr. Kaplan: I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
Rachel: I know!
Mr. Kaplan: I’ll bet your thinking, ‘What’s an intelligent girl
who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?’ Eh?
Rachel: Op.
Mr. Kaplan: Eh.
Rachel: Oh, you got me.
Mr. Kaplan: Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential. Well,
I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion. How does that
sound?
Rachel: Oh, that sounds great.
Mr. Kaplan: Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)
Rachel: Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Mr. Kaplan: (opening the closet door revealing that it’s full of tangled up
hangers.) I need these hangers separated ASAP. (she is stunned) You’re welcome.
[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Rachel is talking to Monica about her job.]
Rachel: Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Monica: I know honey, I’m sorry.
Rachel: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think
why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely
related to the field they’re interested in.
Monica: (gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a
Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Rachel: Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind
paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,
the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
(A guy at the end of the table starts laughing.)
Rachel: (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Guy: I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)
Rachel: It’s not funny, this is actually my job.
Guy: Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at
that Mannequins Plus.
Rachel: Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend
here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Guy: Ah, just one other thing.
Rachel: Yes?!
Guy: I ah, I work at Bloomingdale’s and I might know of a job
possibility if your, if your interested?
Rachel: (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it’s Joey’s party.]
Gunther: (to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.
Monica: Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with
the noisy guy upstairs?
Phoebe: Well, he’s very charming.
Monica: I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then
it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Phoebe: Well, you’re just gonna have to try.
Monica: Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Joey: I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em
around...
(Camera cuts to show Chandler giving a Jello shot to the ceramic dog and holding an
empty tray of Jello shots.)
Joey: Chandler!
Chandler: Hello-dillillio!!
Ross: Oh, somebody’s feeling better.
Monica: (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
Chandler: (to Monica) Take off your shirt!
(Chandler sticks out is tongue and it’s a horrible shade of green.)
Monica: Oh my!!
Joey: Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Chandler: Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Rachel: (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Ross: Hi!
Rachel: Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts
talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and
there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and
he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Ross: Wow!
Rachel: I know!
Ross: What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Rachel: Uh-huh!
Ross: And he’s, he’s a total stranger?
Rachel: Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Ross: Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Rachel: What!?
Ross: Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop
in out of nowhere for no reason.
Rachel: To be nice.
Ross: Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Joey: No, only for sex.
Ross: Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about
me?
Rachel: I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’
sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Ross: Uh-huh.
Joey’s Sisters: (entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look
almost identical)
Joey: Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler: (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Monica: How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.
Chandler: Hi Joey’s sisters!
Phoebe: (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!
Cookie: Hey. What are we drinkin’ over here.
Phoebe: Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Cookie: No kiddin,’ that’s the exact same drink I made myself right
after I shot my husband.
Phoebe: Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.
(Cut to Chandler)
Sister 1: (to Chandler) What ‘cha doing?
Chandler: Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Joey’s Sisters: Oh!!
Chandler: No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily
anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to
one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
(Cut to Ross and Monica)
Ross: Hi.
Monica: Hi.
Ross: Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Monica: Isn’t that great?
Ross: Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good
guy.
Monica: Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I
actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)
Ross: That’s excellent.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]
Ross: (to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark
doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?
Rachel: Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know,
that’s true of any job.
(Chandler enters hungover and groaning)
Monica: How ya feelin’?
Chandler: Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.
Phoebe: Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the
presents.
Ross: Yeah.
Chandler: Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
All: Woooo hoooo!!!
Chandler: Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’ 
Phoebe: Why, what happened?
Chandler: Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,
that’s not the worst part. 
Monica: What is the worse part?
Chandler: I can’t remember which sister.
Ross: (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice!
(points to Chandler) This is men!!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Monica: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually
going to kill you dead.
Chandler: Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
Phoebe: How can you not know which one?
Rachel: I mean that’s unbelievable.
Monica: I mean, was it Gina?
Ross: Which one is Gina?
Rachel: Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Monica: No, no, no, that’s Dina.
Chandler: (to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either,
dwha!!
Phoebe: We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Chandler: Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red
skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Monica: That was me.
Chandler: Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly
friendly, and I’m sorry.
Monica: That’s okay.
Rachel: That’s all right.
Ross: That’s okay.
Joey: (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!
Ross: Hey, Joey.
Rachel: Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)
Joey: Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)
Chandler: Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Joey: I just got off the phone with my sister.
Ross: Ah, which, which one?
Joey: Mary-Angela.
Ross: Mary-Angela.
Joey: Yeah.
Monica: Y'know which one was she again?
Joey: Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled
around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that
true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister. 
Chandler: It’s gotta be the first one.
Joey: Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.
Chandler: Yep, I’m in a tree.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is writing letters as Rachel enters.]
Rachel: Did he call? Did Mark call?
Monica: No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.
Rachel: Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that
Phoebe?
Monica: I guess they’re back from their date.
(He starts to play music.)
Rachel: Music. Very nice.
(We hear them start making out upstairs.)
Monica: Oh my God!
Rachel: So, how are you?
Monica: I am good. I finished my book.
(Things start to get really hot upstairs.)
Rachel: Oh yeah, what’s it about?
Monica: I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Rachel: Yeah, I do. (they both run out)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross is reading a letter that Chandler wrote.]
Ross: Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter
I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do
you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a
letter?
Chandler: Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.
When actually I’ll be in Cuba.
Ross: All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in
person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,
okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her
down easy.
Chandler: What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Ross: Where in Cuba?
[Scene: Joey’s sister’s house, Chandler hits himself on the head three times
and knocks on the door three times. Joey answers it.]
Chandler: (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing
here?
Joey: Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Chandler: I’m here to see Mary-Angela.
Joey: You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,
listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two
yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on
Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Chandler: Where’s Mary-Angela?
Joey: She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)
(Chandler walks into the living room, and sees all of Joey’s sisters, all wearing
red.)
Joey’s Sisters: Hey, Chandler!
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Ross, and Rachel are there.]
Rachel: I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and
he didn’t call.
Ross: Bummer.
Rachel: (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.
Ross: No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look,
Rach, I want only good things for you.
Monica: Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in
shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make
stuff happen.
Ross: But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.
Monica: (to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Ross: (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As
in like, to, to his home?
Rachel: Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good
things for me.
Ross: That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at
Monica)
Rachel: (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,
don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my
number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Ross: That is so made up!
Rachel: (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh
God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!
Monica: Yay!
Ross: There you go.
Rachel: He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Monica: Oh, that is amazing!
Ross: Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.
Rachel: I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.
Ross: High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.
Rachel: Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo
hoo!
Ross: You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in
some way?
Monica: What?
Ross: ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much!
Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically
remove the boyfriend!
Monica: Are you crazy?!
Ross: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy
is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Monica: What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about
Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re
right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Ross: No.
Monica: I mean don’t you trust her?
Ross: Well, yeah!
Monica: Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Ross: (shyly) You grow up.
[Scene: Joey’s sister’s house, they’re finishing up dinner.]
Chandler: This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Joey’s Grandmother: No! I did!
Chandler: Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Joey’s Grandmother: Of course! It’s her favorite.
Chandler: So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?
Joey’s Grandmother: More of Grandma’s teramisu.
Chandler: Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is
great. It’s top notch.
Joey’s Grandmother: That dies with me.
Chandler: So will I.
Joey’s Sister: Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.
Joey’s Sister: (whispering in his ear) Just do it.
Chandler: Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
[Cut to the hall, Joey’s sister runs up and grabs Chandler’s butt.]
Chandler: (startled) Hey!
Joey’s Sister: Finally, I thought we’d never be alone. Can I just tell
you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)
Chandler: Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he
ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in
a, in a commitment kind of place.
Joey’s Sister: So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the
softest lips.
Chandler: Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.
Joey’s Sister: No, I’m Mary-Theresa.
Chandler: This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Mary-Angela: (standing behind Chandler) I am!
Chandler: Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)
Mary-Angela: Joey!!!
Chandler: No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!
Joey: What’s goin’ on?
Chandler: (pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!
Mary-Theresa: It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin’ me because
he thought I was Mary-Angela.
Joey: What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Chandler: I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s
sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really
similar.
Joey’s Sister: I say, punch him Joey.
All: Yeah! Punch him!!
Chandler: Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not
going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
Joey: Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d
be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Chandler: Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want
you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best
friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Cookie: So what. I say, punch him.
All: Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
Joey: No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.
Cookie: I’ll do it.
Joey: No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe
him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all
right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Chandler: Okay, absolutely!
Joey: All right.
Chandler: You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he
still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)
Joey: Cookie, now you can punch him!
Chandler: What?! (Cookie punches him)
[Scene: A lobby, Ross is waiting for Rachel, after her interview.]
Rachel: (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!
Ross: Hi!
Rachel: What are you doing here?
Ross: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)

Rachel: Oh.
Ross: Hi. (kisses her)
Rachel: Hi.
Ross: How’d did it go?
Rachel: Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank
God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy
and wouldn’t shut up.
Ross: I’m so proud of you.
Rachel: Me too!
Ross: Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous
and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...
Rachel: I know.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah.
Mark: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!
Mark: Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the
job.
Rachel: Oh, I did!
Mark: Yes.
Rachel: (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)
Ross: Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.

Monica: So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Phoebe: Oh well y'know. (laughs)
Monica: Yeah, I do know.
Phoebe: Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Rachel: Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Phoebe: Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really
happens to like me.
(We hear the sound of a bed creaking through the ceiling, and him moaning.)
Ross: Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
(We hear a women start moaning.)
Ross: Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Joey: All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy

But, is he a big guy?
Ross: Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)
Phoebe: Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Chandler: Don’t worry.
Phoebe: God, I hope they kick his ass!
Rachel: Honey, I’m sorry.
Monica: Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was
having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)
(We the guys knock on the door upstairs, and the guy answering it.)
Guy: (muffled) May I help you?
(We hear the guys start to attack him, but the guy manages to calm them down and gets
them to agree to what he did. Monica throws up her hands in disgust.)
End[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching Quincy M.E. as Chandler is
walking into the living room from his bedroom.]
Chandler: (sporting a goatee) Hey.
Joey: Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Chandler: Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.
(there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You
should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here
crying all day about Kate.
Joey: Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory.
Okay?
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Ross: (triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!
Chandler: No way!
Ross: Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils
they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
Chandler: Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
Ross: Thanks. You ready to go?
Chandler: Yeah. (they start to leave)
Joey: Saw a girl with that vest.
Chandler: Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
Anchorwoman: (on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as
traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is
intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys
won’t live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little
baby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Joey: (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I
was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Pete is entering, Monica is on roller skates.]

Monica: Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to
skate over to him)
Pete: Wow! Skates! 
(She gets just about all the way over to him and falls into his arms.)
Monica: Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece
of paper. So how was you’re trip?
Pete: Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)
Monica: Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel
toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some

Pete: Ah, which ever is closest. 
Monica: Okay. (hands him a cup)
Pete: So ask me what I did today.
Monica: So what did you do today Pete?
Pete: I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Monica: What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is telling Rachel about Pete’s offer.]
Monica: Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Rachel: What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Monica: I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven
and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can
totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But
Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Rachel: And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
Monica: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I
can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Rachel: Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health
teacher.
Monica: Oh, please. 
(She slaps Rachel’s side and Rachel screams in pain.)

Guess what?
Rachel: (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?
Ross: Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...
Rachel: Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Ross: Right.
Rachel: Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as
stupid as you like.
Ross: (to Monica) You like it right?
Monica: Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!
Rachel: Yeah, come here!
Monica: What-what was it you were gonna tell us? 
Rachel: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Ross: Okay, good bye! (leaves)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about her suggestion.]
Chandler: So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take
for the roller skating thing to happen.
Phoebe: Umm, oh, about three months.
Chandler: Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless
thing kicks in.
Joey: (entering carrying a box) Hey!!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Chandler: Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.
Joey: It’s cute, huh?
Phoebe: Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Chandler: Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Phoebe: Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They
require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s
of love.
Joey: Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,
and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)
Chandler: Easy Lenny.
[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Pete is talking to Monica about the restaurant.]
Pete: So? I mean have you thought about it?
Monica: Okay. Here’s the thing.
Pete: Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?
Monica: I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you
have these feelings for me....
Pete: Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried
about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.
Monica: Huh?
Pete: No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else.
On my trip.
Monica: Oh?
Pete: Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane.
She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had
a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Monica: Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so
happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Pete: I guess you can.
Monica: Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him
on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office
and-and quit!
Pete: All right.
Monica: Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
Pete: Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Monica: (rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls
through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the
door the other way.) I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
Phoebe: (to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Pete: What?
Phoebe: I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?
Pete: Why would you say that?
Phoebe: ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was
somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you
spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Pete: You’re good. You’re good!
Phoebe: Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial
gift.
Pete: Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?
Phoebe: Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Pete: Thanks a lot.
Phoebe: No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is baby-chick sitting.]
Chandler: Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,
and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey
enters)-chickeeeen.
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: How’s she doing?
Chandler: She?
Joey: Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?
Chandler: I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to
determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can’t tell, what ever it was went
back in too quickly.
Joey: Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast
for drinks.
Chandler: Excuse me?
Joey: What?
Chandler: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody
could be here with our chick!
Joey: Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this
morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Chandler: You don’t think I get up when you get up?
Joey: Ohhh, here it comes.
Chandler: Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in
and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well I don’t think so mister!
Joey: Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Chandler: And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
Joey: That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
Chandler: I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this
chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Joey: I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.
Chandler: I’ll take her back tomorrow.
Joey: Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
Ross: (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in
like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This
blue suit, or this brown one?
Joey: Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the
blue one.
Ross: Really? (Joey gives him a ‘Like I would know’ look)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to take some aspirin.]
Rachel: (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble
opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
Ross: Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Rachel: (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
Ross: Oh my God, is that still...
Rachel: I’m fine, I’m fine.
Ross: No you’re not.
Rachel: Yes I am! 
Ross: Rach!
Rachel: Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)
Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)
Whoa-whoa!
Ross: (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a
doctor! Okay?
Rachel: No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses
house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.
Ross: And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m
Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands
with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,
you probably have a broken rib!
Rachel: Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken
then.
Ross: Rach...
Rachel: But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Ross: Rachel...
Rachel: Look, either help me or go.
Ross: Fine. I’ll go.
Rachel: (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you
help me first?
Ross: (He checks his watch) Sure. I’ll help you.
Chandler: (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out
of a VCR?!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Rachel’s bedroom, Rachel is trying to put on eye liner with her left
hand, as Ross is setting out her shoes.]
Rachel: (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!
Would you please, help me with this too?
Ross: Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He
doesn’t like how it tastes.)
Rachel: (taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him
another one.)
Ross: Okay. This stuff? 
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: All right.
Rachel: Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.
Okay? Just sweep it.
Ross: Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
Rachel: Oh-ho!
Ross: Sorry.
Rachel: Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!
Ross: Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...
Rachel: Okay, just sweep it.
Ross: I’m sweeping...
Rachel: Right.
Ross: Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she
has a black eye.)
Rachel: Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...
Ross: What? What?
Rachel: We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
(Of course it’s too late for that.)
Ross: No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachel
is shocked) What?
Rachel: Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?
Ross: Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little
better, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)
Rachel: Blow it.
Ross: (blows it) Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little
more sophisticated.
Rachel: Sophisticated like a hooker?
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is entering, Phoebe is already there.]
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! 
Monica: Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.
Phoebe: What?
Monica: I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Phoebe: Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Monica: I know.
Phoebe: Ooh, I have to tell you something.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: But I can’t tell you.
Monica: Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something
that you could tell me.
Phoebe: Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell,
and I swore to like all my gods.
Monica: Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Phoebe: No.
Monica: Does it have to do with Joey?
Phoebe: No.
Monica: Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his
bed?
Phoebe: No, but let’s come back to that later!
[Scene: Rachel’s Bedroom, Ross is finishing up her make-up.]
Ross: There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
(She turns and looks in the mirror, and it’s way, way over done. She looks like
she has two black eyes.)
Rachel: Sure.
Ross: Yep?
Rachel: Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Ross: Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Rachel: Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Ross: (checks his watch) Sure, okay.
Rachel: Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Ross: What?
Rachel: I don’t want you to see me naked!
Ross: Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you
naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Rachel: Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were
going out then, now I think it’s weird.
Ross: Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Rachel: What?
Ross: All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
Rachel: Ross! Stop that!
Ross: Ah, I’m sorry.
Rachel: Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ross: Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as
the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!
Rachel: Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Ross: Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh!
Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king. 
Rachel: Rosss...
Ross: Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.
Rachel: All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.
Ross: Yowzah!!!
Rachel: O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.
Okay? 
Ross: Aww, come on.
Rachel: That’s it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!! 
Ross: Oh my God!
Rachel: Oh-ow!
Ross: All right.
Rachel: Ow!
Ross: Look...
Rachel: Ow!
Ross: Okay.
Rachel: Ow!
Ross: Rach?
Rachel: Ow! Ow!

Rachel: Okay, I do. 
Ross: Okay.
Rachel: I really do.
Ross: Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in
a cab.
Rachel: Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?
Ross: (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Okay? (goes into the living room)
Rachel: Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)
Oww!!!! God!
Ross: (rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?
Rachel: I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like
this.
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is trying to find out what Phoebe won’t tell her.]
Monica: Does it involve travel?
Phoebe: Noo!
Monica: Does it involve clogs?
Phoebe: Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Monica: Clogs.
Phoebe: No.
Monica: Claws?!
Phoebe: No.
Monica: Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.
But, what about Pete?
Phoebe: (Shaking her head yes) No!
Monica: What is it?! What about Pete?
Phoebe: I don’t know! (frantically points at Monica)
Monica: Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would
you just tell me!
Phoebe: I can’t!!
Monica: Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)
Phoebe: I, but you’re so close! No!

Phoebe: Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching Baywatch with the baby chick.
He’s on one leather chair, the chick is on the other. It’s watching Yasmine
Bleeth run and is chirping.]
Chandler: I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely
different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: (sees he’s watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the
chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store
today.
Chandler: I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her
to the shelter, and you know what I found out? 
(Joey wants to know, but Chandler doesn’t want to discuss it by the chick, so he
and Joey move over to the windows and away from the chick.) 
Chandler: If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m
not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Joey: Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having
second thoughts too. 
Chandler: Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of
other animals!
Joey: That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Chandler: Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.
(He hear a duck start quacking, and see it waddle into the living room from the
bathroom. Joey wants to know what’s with the duck.)
Chandler: Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
[Scene: Pete’s Restaurant’s Kitchen, Pete is showing Monica around the
kitchen.]

gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold.
Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Pete: So you like it?
Monica: Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)
Pete: Oh, you’re welcome. (He takes a deep breath)
Monica: Did you just smell my hair?
Pete: Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Monica: Oh God.
Pete: What?
Monica: You still have feelings for me don’t you?
Pete: Now, nooo! I’m just excited about the restaurant, that’s all.
Monica: Pete.
Pete: Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Monica: No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s
really nice.
Pete: Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.
Monica: You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one
who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.
Pete: What?
Monica: And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m
sorry.
Pete: Okay, yeah. I mean... If that’s, if that’s really what you want,
okay.
Monica: Okay, bye. 
(She kisses him on the cheek, and he kisses her back on the mouth.)
Pete: I’m sorry things didn’t work out...
Monica: All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She
kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)
[Scene: The Hallway Between The Apartments, Ross and Rachel are coming back from the

Ross?
Ross: Oh, it was, nah, well....
Rachel: What thing? What thing?
Ross: Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her
apartment) Easy.
Chandler: (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that,
that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)
[cut to inside Monica and Rachel’s]
Rachel: What thing? What is this thing?
Ross: I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Rachel: Oh my God! 
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?
Ross: Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I
knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Rachel: I cannot believe you.
Ross: What?
Rachel: That is the sweetest thing, I just....
(They both look at each other for a while)
Ross: (breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: So, I’ll umm...
Rachel: Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.
Ross: No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah,

(Joey picks up and turns on a hair dryer.)
EndJoey: (lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode)
Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom
and dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that.
[cut to Phoebe Sr.’s house, from the last episode]
Phoebe Sr.: (to Phoebe) I’m your mother.
Phoebe: Ehh?

a guy like Chandler...
Chandler: (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away
in disgust)
Joey: (voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really
know what happened with that either. 
[cut to a montage of scenes involving Bonnie, Ross, and Rachel from the last episode.]
Joey: (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up
and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has
to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there
either...

[Scene: The beach house, it’s the same scene from the end of last year, with Ross
in front of the two doors of Rachel’s and Bonnie’s rooms, trying to decide which
door to choose. He finally chooses the one his right and goes in.]

Rachel: Oh, you’re welcome a million.
Bonnie: (getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, I’ll see you in our room.
Ross: Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
Rachel: (softly) Oh my God.
Ross: I know.
(They both kiss again and fall onto the bed.)
Ross: (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.
Rachel: Whoa! What?! Why?!
Ross: Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Rachel: Here?! Now?!
Ross: Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in
there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.
Rachel: Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Ross: No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I
can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Rachel: (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
Ross: Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Rachel: I don’t know.
(they kiss again)

[Scene: Phoebe Sr.’s house, it’s right after she told Phoebe that she’s
her birth mother.]

Phoebe: I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,
and everyone started lying their asses off!
Phoebe Sr.: Noo! No! It wasn’t like that I... Remember how I told you how
Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.

Phoebe: I don’t even know how that would work!
Phoebe Sr.: Well, we were...
Phoebe: (interrupting) I’m not asking!
Phoebe Sr.: Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was
stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like to
be eighteen years old?
Phoebe: Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,
and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Phoebe Sr.: Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best
parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years
ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and I
would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Phoebe: Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know
you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked
out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.
Phoebe Sr.: Wait!
Phoebe: I don’t ever want to see you again! 
(She walks out and slams the door.)

purse?

about it?
Phoebe: No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
(She starts to go upstairs.)
Phoebe: (turning around, insistently) Monica!
Monica: Oh.
[Scene: The beach house, Rachel’s bedroom. She is finishing up writing something
as Ross walks through the door.]
Ross: It’s over.
Rachel: Oh, was it awful?
Ross: Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I
noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop
themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
(They kiss.)
Rachel: I wrote you a letter.
Ross: Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns
away.)
Rachel: (handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been
thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us
getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Ross: Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him
from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So,
I’d better get cracking on this baby.
Rachel: Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.
Ross: Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.
Very exciting.
[Scene: The beach house, the next morning. Ross is passed out on the kitchen counter.
He wakes up with a start and has one of the pages of the letter stuck to his face.]
Ross: Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes
reading the letter)
Rachel: (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the
letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why
didn’t you come up?
Ross: Done!
Rachel: You just finished?
Ross: Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very
important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Rachel: So umm, does it?
Ross: I’m sorry.
Rachel: Does it?
Ross: Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’
part just another glance.
Rachel: What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think
about it...
Ross: (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have
to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.
(Rachel stands there for a moment, starting to cry. Then gasps and runs over and hugs
him. While hugging her, Ross tries to find the ‘Does it?’ part in the letter.)
Rachel: Are you sure?
Ross: Oh, sure! I’m sure.
Rachel: I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from
the letter.)
[Scene: The beach. Chandler and Monica are out getting some sun.]
Chandler: All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?
Monica: Ennnh.

Joey: (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you
guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check
this baby out, dug me a hole!
Chandler: Excellent hole, Joe.
(A wave crashes on the beach and partially fills up his hole.)
Joey: Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Monica: (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
Joey: (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!
Monica: Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Chandler: Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Monica: It’s like two miles!
Joey: Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.
Monica: Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Chandler: We’ve got to do something!
Joey: Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.
Monica: What?! What is it?!
Joey: You’re gonna have to pee on it.
Monica: What?!! Gross!!
Joey: Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Chandler: Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia
in that, that like kills the pain.
Monica: Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
Joey: If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
[Scene: The beach house, Phoebe is coming down the stairs all packed and ready to go.]
Phoebe: Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel
cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh!
That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay!
Ohh.
(The rest of the gang arrives with their heads down in shame.)

Monica: Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.
Chandler: Me too!!
Joey: Me too.
Phoebe: Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.
Rachel: Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?
Ross: It does. It really and truly does.
(Rachel kisses him, and goes upstairs. After she’s gone, Ross frantically tries to
find and read the ‘Does it?’ part.)
Ross: (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is telling Joey and Chandler about the letter.]
Ross: She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong
in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful
to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”)
(yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Chandler: Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break
up with you!
Ross: Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says
here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to
Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that
seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”
Joey: No?
Chandler: Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If
you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Ross: (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess
I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Joey: Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to
talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)
ever talk about.
Ross: What the hell happened on that beach?!
Joey: It’s between us and the sea, Ross!
(Ross laughs and has a ‘Come on...’ look on his face as he looks and Chandler
who nods his head in agreement with Joey. Ross is stunned.)
[Scene: A hallway in an apartment building. Phoebe is knocks on a door and it opens.]
Phoebe: (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.
Ursula: Hey!
Phoebe: Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but
umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Ursula: Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Phoebe: (shocked) You know her?!
Ursula: No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note.
Phoebe: There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do
you still have it?
Ursula: (disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in
Phoebe’s face.)
Phoebe: I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!
Ursula: Yeah. So how have you been doing?
Phoebe: I, umm, shut up!
(Ursula opens the door and hands her the note.)
Phoebe: (reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss
you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!
Ursula: Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You
read the poem, right?
Phoebe: Noooo!!
Ursula: All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment
and slams the door shut.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are sitting at the table eating
dinner and not talking. Ross and Rachel are outside cuddling on the balcony.]
Monica: Pass the cheese, please.
(Joey hands her the cheese without looking at her.)
Monica: My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?
Joey: Nope.
(Phoebe enters.)
Chandler: (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Phoebe: No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.
Chandler: I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Ross: (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think
about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Chandler, Monica, and Joey: NO!!!
Rachel: All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?
Monica: What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over
me.
Ross and Rachel: Come on!
Ross: What happened? Joey?
Joey: All right. (gets up) 
Monica: (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!
Chandler: (running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!
Joey: Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me
alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Monica: (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living
room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.
Chandler: (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.
We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s
shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
Monica: I was in too much pain.
Joey: And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Chandler: And then Joey remembered something.
Joey: I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Ross: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About
jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed
on yourself?!
Phoebe and Rachel: Ewwww!!
Monica: You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I
was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way.
So... (looks at Joey.)
Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel: (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!
Joey: That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help!
And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the
stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to
Chandler.
Chandler: (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it
now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the
screaming.
Joey: (laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to
freak you out.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is finishing up a song.]
Phoebe: (singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my
bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the
colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.
You go away.
Phoebe Sr.: I’ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there
hasn’t been a day where I didn’t regret giving you up.
Phoebe: Okay, bye.
Phoebe Sr.: No, I’m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the
reason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just well
like, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, y'know,
start from here?
Phoebe: No.
Phoebe Sr.: Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family.
I’m family, I’m it. Now, now I’m done. (starts to leave)
Phoebe: But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?
Phoebe Sr.: Yeah, I guess you’re right.
Phoebe: It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything
in common.
Phoebe Sr.: Well, I don’t know. I mean it’s not like we don’t
have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
Phoebe: I-I like pizza!
Phoebe Sr.: You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Phoebe: Oh my God, so do I!
Phoebe Sr.: I knew it, wow!!
Phoebe: Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Phoebe Sr.: Ohh, so cute.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.
Phoebe Sr.: I know. I’m mad at me too.
Phoebe: Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.
Phoebe Sr.: Hey! Me too!
Phoebe: All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.
[Scene: Rachel’s bedroom. Ross and Rachel have just finished consummating the new
relationship.]
Rachel: Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Ross: I missed you too.
Rachel: Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to
everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?
Ross: (getting miffed) I suppose.
Rachel: You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never
thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”
Ross: (getting angry) Umm-hmm.
Rachel: Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was
what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
[cut to Monica cleaning the floor in the kitchen]
Ross: (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Chandler: (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
Monica: You bet.
[cut back to Rachel’s bedroom with both of them hurriedly getting dressed]
Ross: And for the record, it took two people to break up this
relationship!!
Rachel: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!
Ross: I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didn’t finish the whole letter!
Rachel: What?!!
Ross: I fell asleep!
Rachel: You fell asleep?!
Ross: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and
back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen)
(to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’
Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
Rachel: Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)
Rachel: Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy
when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Monica: Hey!!
Rachel: (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep
you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Ross: Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have
your letter!!!
Rachel: And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler: I KNEW IT!!!!

game naked.
Monica: Will you stop!
Chandler: Okay. All right.
Monica: Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet,
and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.

closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)
Rachel: Hello, Chip.
Chip: Hey, Rach! How ya doin’?

never felt better about myself.

Chip: Amy Welch? Wow! I haven’t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is showing off the entertainment center.]
Joey: This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage
compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Guy: What?!
Joey: Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I
couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It
was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Guy: No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.
Joey: Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can’t,
I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Guy: All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)
Joey: Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! 
(The guys takes a hockey stick and slips it through the handles then proceeds to take
the stereo and Chandler’s computer and walk out.)
Joey: Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
[Scene: A street, Chip is walking Monica to his motorcycle.]
Chip: Here, we are.
Monica: Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Chip: The what?

Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire,
J.T., Breadsly.
Monica: Is that all?
Chip: Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran
into Richard Dorfman.
Monica: Ohh, how is he?
Chip: Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Monica: Isn’t he an architect now?
Chip: Yeah, they still wear underwear.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is coming home. As we walks through the door, and
without looking up, he goes to throw his keys on the foosball table, only, it’s gone

except for the entertainment center and that ceramic dog. Even the food in the fridge!]
Chandler: OH MY GOD!!!
Joey: (still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! 
Chandler: Are you all right?!
Joey: Yeah...
Chandler: (lets him out) What happened?!!
Joey: (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
Chandler: What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell
is all of our stuff?!!
Joey: Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t
think big enough to fit a grown man!
Chandler: So—You got in voluntarily?!
Joey: I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy
again, do you know what I’m gonna do?
Chandler: BEND OVER?!!!
[Scene: Dot’s Spot, Chip and Monica are on there date, eating dinner. Chip is
telling a story.]
Chip: ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)
Monica: Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school
with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I
don’t even know where you work?
Chip: You know where I work!
Monica: I do?
Chip: The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Monica: You still work at the multiplex?
Chip: Oh, like I’d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I
want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Monica: Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?
Chip: Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
(Monica takes a big swig of her martini.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Rachel, Phoebe, and Julio are consoling Joey and
Chandler.]

Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Monica: (entering) Oh my God! What happened?
Chandler: Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Rachel: (to Monica) So, how was your date?
Monica: Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high
school?
Rachel: Um-hmm.
Monica: Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Rachel: Oh honey, I’m sorry.
Monica: No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I
got to dump Chip Matthews.
Rachel: Ohh! That’s so great!
Monica: I know!
Ross: (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Chandler: Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop
calling us.”
Ross: (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda
shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Phoebe: Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
Ross: Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all
over the place.
Rachel: I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)
Monica: Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Phoebe: Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to
respect her decision. Right?
Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel: That’s a good call. Right.
Ross: No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel
guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.
This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Phoebe: (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,
how many parents have you lost?
Ross: None.
Phoebe: Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes
back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a
friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Ross: I’m sorry.
Phoebe: Okay.
Ross: I don’t know what to say.
Rachel: You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.
Phoebe: I think she would like that.
Ross: (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.
Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you
were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s
mother.
Phoebe: Thank you. We both forgive you.
Rachel: So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Phoebe: Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to
me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.
Chandler: Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate
it. (Joey nods in agreement)
Phoebe: Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.
Rachel: I’ll go with you.
Monica: Me too. (they all leave)
Ross: Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.
Joey: Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Closing Credits
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler have trading the entertainment center
for the canoe. Joey is sitting in the bow, staring off into space as to envision his
future full of possibilities. Chandler is sitting at the stern, staring into space and is
looking at an uncertain future.]
EndRoss: You're welcome for a delicious dinner. 
[inside] 

Phoebe: Hey what are you guys looking at? 

Chandler: Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world. 

Phoebe: Yeah, come to papa. 
[Cheryl walks away and Ross walks inside. Everyone stares at him in disbelief.] 

Ross: I know! 

Monica: Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass
on her? 

Chandler: Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of
Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that? 

Rachel: Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics
instructor, what? 

Ross: Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the
centazoic era. 

Chandler: Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. 

Ross: I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her
dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow. 

Rachel: Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can
bring home the biggest geek. 

Ross: Fine by me; hope she wins. 

Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Chandler enters.] 

Chandler: Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper? 

Phoebe: Oo! Is it for my birthday present? 

Chandler: Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago. 

Phoebe: Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just
hasn't come yet? 

Chandler: Well, I have a call in about that. 

Phoebe: 'Kay. 

Chandler: Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her
favorite book. 

Rachel: Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the
rabbit real! 

Chandler: Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. 

Rachel: Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this
is pretty rare. How did you get that? 

Chandler: Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked
to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. 

Rachel: Oh, honey, that's so sweet. 

Phoebe: Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's
girlfriend!" 

Chandler: It doesn't say that. Does it? 

Ross: How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly
meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange? 

Chandler: Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something
really great. 

Phoebe: It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow! 

Monica: (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am
sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for
sixty people. 

Rachel: Oh my God! What happened? 

Monica: Sixty guests. 

Ross: So, uh, why did you have to turn it down? 

Monica: Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that
big on such short notice. I mean there's no way. 

Phoebe: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not
Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing
around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not? 

Monica: I don't know. 

Phoebe: There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend
you money, but just get moving! 

Monica: Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and
stuff. 

Phoebe: Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in
months. 

Monica: Well, you're not working either. 

Phoebe: Yes, but I'm doing this. 

Monica: Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you! 
[Joey enters] 

Joey: Hey! 

Everyone: Hey. 

Kathy: Can I borrow the keys to your apartment? 

Joey: Why? 
[Kathy whispers something in Joey's ear] 

Joey: You can pee here! 

Kathy: Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me. 

Chandler: It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the
bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? 

Joey: We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her
something? 

Everyone: Yeah! 

Rachel: Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.


Joey: Oh, I know... 

Rachel: And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love." 
[cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting, Phoebe
is nearby.] 

Phoebe: Ooo, a crossword! Can I help? 

Rachel: No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers
and I really want to finish a whole one without any help. 

Phoebe: Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language. 
[Monica enters] 

Monica: Hey! 

Rachel: Hey, how'd it go? 

Monica: Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food,
and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's
best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident! 

Phoebe: Mon! I'm so happy for you! 

Monica: Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying
pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order! 

Phoebe: I'll have one, please. Plus my money. 

Monica: Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you
told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this
stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I
make from that. 

Phoebe: Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank. 

Monica: Okay. 
[Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment, Ross and Cheryl are kissing] 

Ross: (moved by the kiss) Huh... 

Cheryl: Um, would you like to come in? 

Ross: Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools? 

Cheryl: According to recent findings! 
[They go into the apartment. Inside the apartment it looks like a sewage dump exploded
and landed in her living room. There are clothes and food and junk covering every square
inch of space. I mean pigs have nicer pens. Ross is completely shocked.]

Cheryl: (throwing food around the room) Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi! 

Ross: Mitzi is..... 

Cheryl: My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat. 

Ross: (mouths "where?") Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage
and falters) ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties? 

Cheryl: What? 

Ross: Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles,
break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh... 

Cheryl: I'd rather not. 

Ross: Oh, yeah, why not? 

Cheryl: Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird
smell. 
[Scene: A kitchen where Phoebe and Monica are finishing up a catering job] 

Monica: Oh, is everything in the car? 

Phoebe: Yes. Did you settle the bill? 

Monica: No. I hate this part. 

Phoebe: Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker) 

Monica: No, that's not mine. 

Phoebe: Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took! 
[cut to the living room of the same dwelling, where the funeral guests are mingling.
Monica enters.] 

Monica: Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen. 

Mrs. Burkart: Oh, good. Thank you. 

Monica: Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of... 

Mrs. Burkart: Dear? 

Monica: Just the matter of ...payment? 

Mrs. Burkart: (in grief) Jack used to handle the finances! (Breaks into tears) 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on the couch still doing the crossword. Chandler
is in the kitchen.] 

Rachel: You know what we should all do? Go see a musical. 

Chandler: (confused) Sure... 

Rachel: And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you
happen to know the name of that one? 

Chandler: I don't know... um, Grease? 

Rachel: No.... 

Chandler: Rent? 

Rachel: Yes! Rent! 

Chandler: Okay, so when do you want to go? 

Rachel: What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy. 

Joey: (entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 

Chandler: Yes, it is, at Office Max. 

Rachel: What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a
pen.) 

Chandler: A pen.

Joey: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? 

Chandler: Huh-huh! You can't give her that. 

Joey: Why not? 

Chandler: Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! 

Rachel: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift,
maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? 

Joey: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over....
"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" 

Chandler: All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio
for her birthday? 

Joey: She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 

Chandler: For three years? 

Joey: (whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an
audition. I can't shop anymore! I... 

Chandler: All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay? 

Joey: Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? 

Chandler: Would you like me to write her a little poem as well? 

Joey: Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it. 
[Scene: Back in the kitchen at the funeral. Phoebe is there, Monica enters.] 

Phoebe: But Mon, you have to get our money! 

Monica: Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears
looked giant. 

Phoebe: I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's
funeral was? 

Monica: What? 

Phoebe: Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some
people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage
wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know,
"these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!" 

Monica: Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking? 

Phoebe: Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. 

Monica: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. 
[cut to the living room where Mrs. Burkart is now performing.] 

Mrs. Burkart: (singing) You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and
forever in peace may you wave.... 

Phoebe: She seems fine now. 

Mrs. Burkart: (singing) ...emblem of the land I love. The home of.... 

Commercial Break
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are standing and talking, Ross is tying a
tie.] 

Joey: So, you just left? Her place was really that bad? 

Ross: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? 

Joey: Yeah. 

Ross: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead
of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of
time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands
it to Joey who puts it on.) Here. 

Joey: Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? 

Ross: What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there. 

Joey: All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. 

Ross: No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell. 

Joey: What kind of smell? 

Ross: I don't know. Soap? 

Joey: All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? 

Ross: Yeah. 

Joey: You wanna see her again, right? 

Ross: Yeah. 

Joey: So you're gonna have to do it in the mess! 

Ross: Yeah, okay you're right. 

Joey: Yeah. 

Ross: I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness? 

Joey: Yeah! 

Ross: It's, uh... it's endearing, really. 

Joey: All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure)
Oink! 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel, Rachel is there, Chandler enters.] 

Chandler: Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present
for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit. 

Rachel: Any luck? 

Chandler: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things
for Kathy." (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a
hand with all this stuff? 

Rachel: All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the
clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. 

Chandler: She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her
to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. 

Rachel: Aw, honey, that's so sweet. 

Chandler: Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? 

Rachel: Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.) 

Joey: (entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over
for you! 

Chandler: Where? 

Joey: Our place, the hall! I... 

Chandler: I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to
his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book! 

Joey: (Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a
safe? 

Chandler: No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen
Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes
it, okay? 

Joey: You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves,
comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? 

Chandler: No, it came out to an even twenty. 

Joey: Wow. That's almost as much as a new book. 
[Scene: In the living room at the funeral] 

Mrs. Burkart: (singing) Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers,
creepers, where'd you get those eyes? 
[cut to Monica and Phoebe in the kitchen] 

Phoebe: You didn't get the money, did you? 

Monica: Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's
just go! 

Phoebe: No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks
she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow? 

Mrs. Burkart: (Singing) Come on along and listen to... 

Phoebe: Okay, Widow! 

Mrs. Burkart: (Singing) ...the lullabye of... 

Phoebe: Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this
is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to
be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid
every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place
else to go. 

Mrs. Burkart: All right. I'll get my bag. 

Phoebe: Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with
everyone staring at her.) 

Monica: I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event. 
[Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment.] 

Cheryl: So you want to come inside? 

Ross: (mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.) 

Cheryl: I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable. (Ross attempts to clear a
place for his coat and fold it small enough to fit. Then hit sits on the couch. Something
falls on him from above and he brushes his neck off frantically.) 

Cheryl: (sneaking up behind Ross) Guess who? 

Ross: Department of Sanitation? 

Cheryl: It's me! 

Ross: Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch.
Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and
gooey.) 

Cheryl: What? 

Ross: (trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl! 

Cheryl: Oh, Ross! 
[They sit up, moaning in excitement, and Cheryl straddles Ross. Ross finds a slice of
bologna and moans higher and louder, then a bag of potato chips on the coffee table starts
to move. Ross throws Cheryl off his lap, grabs a tennis racket and a toilet brush and
starts pounding the bag.] 

Cheryl: Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi! 

Ross: Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out. 

Cheryl: (looking in the bag) Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat. 
[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is sitting on the couch alone working on a crossword
puzzle. Gunther is there, going into the back room.] 

Rachel: I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to
hug! 
[From the background we hear a crash and Gunther comes running out of the back room,
pushing people aside, reaching for Rachel.] 

Gunther: Move! 
[Gunther slips and falls just before reaching the back of the couch. Monica and Phoebe
come into Central Perk.] 

Rachel: Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me! 
[Gunther gets up slowly from behind the couch and walks away sadly] 

Phoebe: Uh... yay! 

Rachel: Thanks! 

Monica: Oh, that's great! Congratulations! 

Rachel: Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go? 

Monica: Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she
did. 

Phoebe: Yeah. I'm a hard ass. 

Monica: And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners. 

Phoebe: Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime! 

Monica: Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be
catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such
a great time together! 

Phoebe: Okay! 

Monica: I can cook and you can take care of the money. 

Phoebe: Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties! 

Both: (screaming with excitement) Aah! 
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is there, Joey enters.] 

Joey: Hey! 

Chandler: Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift? 

Joey: Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now. 

Chandler: Oh yeah? That's great! 

Joey: Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this,
because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! 

Chandler: [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh.... 
[Kathy enters] 

Kathy: Hey. 

Joey: Hey! 

Chandler: Hey! Happy birthday. 

Kathy: Thank you! 

Joey: You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got
you a gift, too. 

Chandler: No he didn't. [Moving it back.] 

Joey: Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho! 

Chandler: Happy birthday! I'm sorry. 

Kathy: You really didn't have to. (Opens the box) Wow. 

Chandler: See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a
clock. 

Kathy: Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. (They hug). 

Chandler: Oh, yeah... yeah. 

Joey: Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed? 

Kathy: I'll be in in a minute. 

Joey: Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against
the doorway to his room. Then goes inside). 

Chandler: [to Kathy] Goodnight. 

Kathy: Um, thank you for the gift. 

Chandler: Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you...
you don't always know the exact time. 

Kathy: No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book. 

Chandler: Uh, the book? 

Kathy: The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to
do with it. 

Chandler: What do you mean? 

Kathy: Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya
like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it
must have been for you to find. 

Chandler: (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound
was, "Uhl, ell." 

Kathy: You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him. 

Chandler: Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend. 

Kathy: Well.... 

Chandler: Goodnight. (Goes to his room.) 

Joey: (opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know. 

Closing Credits
[Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment, Monica knocks on Cheryl's door] 

Monica: Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister. 

Cheryl: Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out. 

Monica: Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep,
thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it? 
[Cheryl shrugs, shuts the door, looking puzzled] 

Monica: No? 
[Monica looks around the hallway, pulls out a sponge and starts scrubbing the door
frame.] 

EndRachel: Oh my God.
Chandler and Joey: YEAH!!! YES!!!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are carrying
in the foosball table.]
Joey: I call Monica’s room!
Chandler: You can’t just call Monica’s room.
Joey: Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I
called it.
(Chandler grunts and turns around, sees that he’s in sight of the room, and mouths
damn!)
Monica: Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.
Joey: What?
Monica: Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils
are? I’ll bet the apartment!
Chandler: Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Phoebe: Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.
Monica: How do you feel?
Phoebe: Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky.
And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally
putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Chandler: Yeah, but I bet it works.
Monica: Really?! How much?!
Phoebe: All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Joey: Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Phoebe: Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always
been a little faster than Western medicine. 
Rachel: (entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball
table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in
here!
Chandler: Well believe it baby!
Rachel: Well I-I-I’m not moving.
Joey: What?!

Rachel: No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Joey: You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Monica: Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve
made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Rachel: Noooo.
Monica: All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel
better, it’s all your fault.
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Chandler: I knew it!
Rachel: I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.
Chandler: Cool, girl roommate.
(Phoebe comes in from the bathroom as Rachel sits down in disgust.)
Monica: Well?
Phoebe: Nope, not knocked up yet.
Monica: It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Phoebe: Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do whatever I can to help
this so, I’m just gonna y’know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair
and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let gravity
y’know, do its jobs.
[Cut too later, the moving process is progressing steadily. Monica is trying to lift a
heavy box, as Rachel comes in from Chandler’s bedroom.]
Monica: Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Rachel: No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment
and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s
dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and
it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not
moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is
shaking uncontrollably.) 
Monica: I’ll take care of it.
Rachel: That’s right! You do what the hand says!
[Cut to later, Phoebe is still in the chair and Rachel is laying down as Monica
enters.]
Rachel: How did it go?
Monica: I lost our mattresses.
[Cut to still later, Rachel has now resigned herself to move and is now helping Monica.
Phoebe is still on the chair.]
Phoebe: (singing) "Are you in there little fetus? 
                            
In nine will you come great us? 
                            
I will buy you some Adidas."
(There’s a knock on the door and Monica answers it.)
Monica: Hey!
Frank and Alice: (entering) Hi!
Alice: Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little
present.
Phoebe: Oh. Oh.
Frank: Umm, it’s a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Monica: Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Alice: So umm, you feel like taking a test? There’s only one question.
Phoebe: All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that
it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that
doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please,
just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
Alice: Okay.
Frank: Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)
Phoebe: Great. (Goes to take the test.)
(The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)
Rachel: Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Joey: Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question
wrong!
Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!
Ross: Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving
day for us!
Rachel: Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Joey: But it is our apartment!
Rachel: No it’s not!
(They all decay into massive bickering as Phoebe returns from the bathroom.)
Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna
have a baby!
Frank: MY SISTER’S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!

(They all go over and hug Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.
All: Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)
Closing Credits
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are busy
unpacking.]
Monica: I can’t find garbage bags!
Rachel: Oh, I think I saw some in here. 
(She opens a door and they both scream at horror at what’s inside of it.)
Monica: What is it?!
Rachel: I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll
die.
Monica: I can’t believe we’re living here!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, they’re both unpacked. The
big ceramic dog has found a new home in front of the window. Joey screams and runs into
the living room.]
Chandler: What?! What-what is it?!
Joey: Did you see the size of the closets?!
Chandler: I can’t believe we live here!
(They both sit down on the chairs and put up the foot rest.)
Chandler and Joey: Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
EndEmily: No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Rachel: Well, it was all Ross’s idea.
Emily: You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!
Ross: You really didn’t know?
[Cut to later, the party is in full swing. Rachel is in the kitchen and Chandler goes
over to talk to her.]
Chandler: Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to
the living room.)
Rachel: Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s
looking over here, say something funny.
Chandler: Like what?
(Rachel laughs hysterically.)
Joey: What-what-what is so funny?
Chandler: I said, "Like what?"
Joey: Now that’s a thinker.
Rachel: Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing
is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She
does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!
Joshua: Hi!
Rachel: Care for a cherry?
Joshua: Oh, no thanks.
Rachel: No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my
tongue. 
(She tries to demonstrate this unique ability, but only succeeds in choking on it.)
Joshua: You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy
smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)
Ross: (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
Emily: Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!
Ross: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15
minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.
Emily: So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Ross: No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very
short. It’s usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I’m so
surprised—good-bye!"
Emily: But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been
telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea
parties.
Ross: Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly
and Monica winces in pain.)
[Cut to Joey and Phoebe in the kitchen. Phoebe is watching Joey make a sandwich.]
Phoebe: Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Joey: A little salami. 
Phoebe: Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Joey: Pastrami. 
Phoebe: Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.
(Rachel enters, she has changed clothes.)
Rachel: Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Joey: Yeah. (He goes over to her.)
Rachel: Up!
Monica: You changed?
Rachel: Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Monica: And lucky means, more cleavage? 
Chandler: Does for me.
(Joey starts wiping lint off of her back, but goes at little too far and Rachel just
glares at him. He stops, gives her the ‘okay’ symbol and walks away.)
Rachel: Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab
him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Joey: Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Rachel: What?
Joey: There was a seen in Footloose...
Chandler: Flashdance.
Joey: Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…
Chandler: She was a welder.
Joey: What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off
her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Monica: Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Rachel: It’s not Christmas!
Monica: Or Spin the Bottle?
Rachel: He’s not 11!
Emily: (with her coat on, she’s leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for
this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Rachel: What? You’re leaving?!
Ross: Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Joshua: Uhh, yeah, I think I’m going to take-off too.
Rachel: No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole
big thing planned!
Ross: What big thing?
[Cut to later, the whole group is seated on the floor and Rachel is explaining the
rules of Spin the Bottle.]
Rachel: (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the
bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where
Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides
not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Emily: I’ll go.
All: Yay!
(Emily spins the bottle and it lands on Joey.)
Joey: Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)
(Joey spins the bottle and it lands on Emily.)
Monica: Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss
again.)
Rachel: Yay! Emily! 
(Emily spins the bottle and once again, it lands on Joey.)
Chandler: What are the odds? What are the odds?
(They both move to kiss again.)
Ross: (stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s,
let’s let someone else play.
Joey: If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?
Rachel: Okay, my turn!!
(Rachel spins the bottle and it lands on….wait for it….Joshua. (You thought I
was going to say Ross, didn’t you?) Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy
crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her
cleavage.)
Phoebe: Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
All: Ohh!
Rachel: It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!
All: Oh my God!
(They all stand up and go over to Phoebe to feel the baby, preventing Rachel from
kissing Joshua.)
Rachel: All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. 
(She crawls over to Joshua and kisses the back of his knee. He feels it and looks down,
Rachel pretends she’s knocking a bug off his leg.)
Rachel: Just a bug.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, it is later in the party. The
Spin the Bottle game is over and Chandler is making a sandwich as Phoebe watches.]
Phoebe: Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it.
Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded
murder.
Chandler: Okay. 
(He takes a bite out of the sandwich and as he does so, Phoebe attacks the other end
and starts devouring the sandwich.)
Chandler: There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the
sandwich to Phoebe.)
Joey: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Phoebe: I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Joey: All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating
someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really
hot?
Phoebe: Yeah, totally!
Joey: All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going
to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!
[Cut to later, Phoebe is finishing off her steak.]
Joey: Feel better now?
Phoebe: Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m
gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.
Joey: Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Joey: Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals
would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.
Phoebe: Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.
Joey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?
[Cut to Ross and Emily standing by the foosball table.]
Ross: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked
for our check right away.
(Rachel enters, she has changed once again. This time into her high school cheerleading
uniform.)
Emily: But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a
skit.
Monica: Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress
wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Monica: Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—(pause), actually
I kinda want to see what happens.
Joshua: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Joshua: Nice uh, costume.
Rachel: Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye
cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’
All: E!
Rachel: Gimme an ‘M!’
All: M!
Rachel: Gimme an ‘I!’
All: I!
Rachel: Gimme an ‘L!’
All: L!
Rachel: Gimme a ‘Y!’
All: Y!
Rachel: What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and
performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in
Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s
the only one that claps.)
(Joey and Monica rush over to her.)

Joey and Monica: Are you all right?
Rachel: I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no
big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do
now?
Monica: I think you’re done.
Joey: Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)
Joshua: Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Joey: (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
Rachel: All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.
Joshua: Okay.
(They both go to Chandler’s bedroom to get his coat.)
[Cut to Gunther and Emily.]
Gunther: Rachel is my girlfriend.
[Cut to Chandler’s bedroom.]
Joshua: So, this was uh, really fun.
Rachel: Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra…
Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my
bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could
talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently
pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)
Joshua: Need uh, need a little hand there.
Rachel: Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Joshua: You really don’t seem like you do. That’s…
(She is still yanking on the bra, but it is stuck in her sleeve. Finally, she gives
up.)
Rachel: Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not
how this is supposed to happen.
Joshua: Well, what was supposed to happen?
Rachel: Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that
if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Joshua: Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to
work, and I bought six of them from you.
Rachel: Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!
Joshua: No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted
to see you.
Rachel: Why?!
Joshua: Because I-I like you.
Rachel: You like me?
Joshua: Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and
sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight.
Rachel: Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all
this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Joshua: But…
Rachel: Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s
just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Joshua: Okay uh, however…
Rachel: Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.
Joshua: My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get
into anything yet.
Rachel: But….
Joshua: I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Rachel: Okay.
[Scene: The hallway, Ross is sitting on the step drinking a beer as Rachel comes out of
the guys apartment.]
Rachel: Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so
you and Emily are free to go.
Ross: That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and
uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…
Rachel: Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Ross: Helps a little.
Rachel: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Ross: Yeah, have a seat.
Rachel: I’m so sorry.
Ross: That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just
didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?
Rachel: Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?
Ross: What do you mean?
Rachel: You seem to really like her.
Ross: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you
don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
Ross: You think?
Rachel: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross: Hey, you’re right.
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
Rachel: I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Ross: Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
Rachel: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Rachel: You’re a pathetic loser, right?
Chandler: Oh-ho, yeah!
Rachel: Sit!
(He does so, and immediately starts looking pathetic.)
Joshua: Hi. (He has just returned.)
Rachel: Oh my gosh, Joshua!
Joshua: All those things I said about not being ready…
Rachel: They’re not true?
Joshua: No, they’re-they’re all true.
Rachel: Oh.
Joshua: But…
Rachel: Oh! Oh, I love that but.
(They move to kiss, but realise that Chandler is staring at them. Chandler urges them
on.)
Rachel: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Joshua: Yeah.
Rachel: Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next day. Phoebe is busy
making a sandwich.]
Joey: Oooh, what you got there?
Phoebe: Pastrami.
Joey: Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?
Phoebe: Hm-mm, corn beef.
Joey: Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a
little of that smoked turkey?
Phoebe: Okay.
Joey: (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is
the baby due?
Phoebe: Six months.
Joey: Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those
right?
Phoebe: Not if I get there first.
EndChandler: We don’t know what could make this go away.
Joey: Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Chandler: And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey: Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Monica: Well at least, I’m going to mute it.

Joey and Chandler: Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look
behind them)
Chandler: We still have porn.
Joey: Hey.
Phoebe: (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Rachel: Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica
right away.)
Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid
massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She
goes over and stands in front of the TV.)
Chandler: Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
Phoebe: You mean like a doctor?
Joey: Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!
Phoebe: Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN
today.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross: Hi.
Monica: Hi.
Ross: So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Monica: Oh. Why didn’t you take her?
Ross: Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we
said our good-byes this morning, so…
Monica: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross: (Thinks about it.) Nah.
Monica: Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?
Ross: Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I
brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so fantastic! Why do
we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"
Monica: (interrupting him) No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent.
You’ve got to see her again.
Ross: And why do you care so much?
Monica: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?
Monica: No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,
fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that
Ukrainian kid?
Monica: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ross: Ahh.
Monica: Do you love her?
Ross: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?
Monica: You love her!
Ross: What-what is love really?
Monica: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport
and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to
the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And
she’s gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most
amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Ross: I am a good kisser.
Monica: Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to
heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (Ross looks at her.) I’ve been watching
too much porn.
[Scene: Beth Israel Medical Center, Phoebe is at her OB-GYN doing an ultrasound, Rachel
is with her. We here the baby’s heartbeat.]
Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?
The Doctor: That’s it.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Rachel: Oh wow! This is so cool.
(The heartbeat changes, and we hear a different one.)
The Doctor: Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Phoebe: Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,
I’ll hold onto your card, okay?
The Doctor: No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats.
Phoebe: Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!
The Doctor: Doctors are wrong all the time.
Phoebe: Well, yeah.
Rachel: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
The Doctor: Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)
Phoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months
I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh!
Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
The Doctor: Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different
from giving birth to one.
Phoebe: What do you know?!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there, waiting to tell Frank and Alice the news.]
Alice: (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Phoebe: Ooh! Hi!
Alice: Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebe’s stomach.) So, how did it go at
the doctors?
Phoebe: Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re
walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh,
that’s nice?"
Frank: Yes.
Phoebe: Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.
Alice: Three babies?
Frank: I finally got my band!
Alice: We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!
Phoebe: Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were
going to be all freaked.
Frank: Why would we be freaked?
Phoebe: No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added
expense, and…
Frank: (They’re less than happy now) Oh.
Alice: Right.
Phoebe: No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Alice: No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach
Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y’know
it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop. 
Frank: Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having
triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
Alice: No, Frank.
Phoebe: No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
Frank: Yeah, refrigerator college.
Alice: Yeah.
Frank: Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby,
y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career—and I
love refrigerators!
Phoebe: You can’t give up on your dream.
Frank: No, it’s okay. We’re-we’re gonna have three kids! And
that’s-that’s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
[Scene: The airport, Emily is getting ready to board her flight to London.]

Ticket Agent: (On the P.A.) This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Ross: Emily! (Runs up.)
Emily: Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)
Ross: I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Emily: You are so sweet. (They kiss.)
Ross: That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding
one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.
Emily: Me too.

Ticket Agent: This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Emily: Well, that’ me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him
the candy bar.) I’m only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the
jetway.)
Ross: (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,
I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I
think I love you.
Emily: Oh. (She’s shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)
Ross: That’s no problem.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Rachel is singing some kind of
song.]
Rachel: What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Chandler: It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
Rachel: Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend
Joshua.
Joey: Yeah right.
Rachel: No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Chandler: Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was
corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Rachel: Yes!
Joey: Yeah, he likes porn.
(Rachel starts to leave.)
Monica: Where ya going?
Rachel: I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too
skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey.
Joey: Hey!
Monica: How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Phoebe: Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is
having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I
want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company.
Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Chandler: They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get
you some free white out though.
(Ross enters.)
Monica: Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Ross: I did.
Monica: And well, what did she say?
Ross: Thank you.
Monica: Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?
Ross: She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she
said, "Thank you."
Chandler: Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Joey: Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Ross: What do I do now?
Joey: You play hard to get.
Ross: She already lives in London.
Joey: Then you go to Tokyo.
Chandler: All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,
it’s over.
Monica: It is not over! You’re over!
Chandler: What?
Monica: You know!
Chandler: Okay. (Pause) Good one.
Monica: It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves
you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it
scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the
plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)
Ross: Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait.
Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and,
and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s
over.
(Joey holds his fist up, and Chandler gives him two thumbs up.)
Joey: Way to be strong, man!
(Ross leaves, and after the door closes, Joey gives him the loser sign.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Joey enter having
just woken up.]
Rachel: Hey!
Chandler: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn
break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Rachel: Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?
Chandler: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Phoebe: (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: Well, what-what ‘cha got there?
Phoebe: Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a
knife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an
ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’re
thinking…
Chandler: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Monica: Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?
Phoebe: No!
Monica: Are you sure?
Phoebe: No!
Rachel: Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice
just by selling knives.
Phoebe: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second
part of my plan.
Chandler: What’s the second part of your plan?
Phoebe: My Saturn dealership.
[Scene: Ross’s bedroom, he has fallen asleep waiting for Emily to call. He is
awaken by the phone.]
Ross: (Answers the phone.) Hello?
Emily: Ross.
Ross: Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Emily: It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those
wonderful things.
Ross: No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you
called.
Emily: Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you,
there’s-there’s someone else.
Ross: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is relating his recent
conversation with Emily to the gang.]
Ross: She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Monica: This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be
another guy.
Ross: Well…
Monica: Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you
have to prove your love!
Ross: I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I
hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never
would’ve put my fist through the wall!
Chandler: You put your fist through the wall?
Ross: No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Monica: You have to go to London!
Ross: What?
Monica: Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Joey: Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her
you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that
there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!
Monica: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Ross: I made fun of his accent.
Monica: You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I
right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Ross: No.
Monica: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be
you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Ross: Really?
Monica: Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go
without a fight!
Ross: All right. All right, I’m gonna do it! 
Monica: All right.
Ross: I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight
for her.
Monica: Okay, good luck!
(Ross starts to leave.)
Joey: Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up
another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are
sitting and talking as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m
gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it
around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!
Monica: That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Rachel: Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys
used for catering and we realised…
Phoebe: I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need
massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the
massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know
what I’ve got?
Chandler: A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Phoebe: No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to
relax, it’s…
Rachel: (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
Phoebe: The name was my favourite part!
Rachel: Well, well I can up with it!
Phoebe: YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s
not good.
Rachel: Well, I…
(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
Monica: Hello.
Ross: (on phone) Hey.
Monica: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
[Cut to Ross in one of those British phone booths.]
Ross: No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home
all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron
who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Monica: All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Ross: About four hours.
Monica: Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show
up by then, then just come on home.
Phoebe: Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks
that’s better than Relaxi Cab.
Rachel: Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab. 
Phoebe: Oh, that is better.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same night. There is a
knock on the door and Chandler answers it to reveal Emily standing behind it.]
Chandler: Are we in London?
Monica: What are you doing here? You can’t be here!
Emily: I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross.
(She sets her bag down on the foosball table and Joey sees the Toblerone bar
sticking out of it and gazes longingly at it.)
Emily: What?
Joey: (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.
Emily: I was going to call him, but…
Monica: Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I
was right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?
Emily: I’d really rather talk to him. 
Monica: Oh.
Emily: I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. I
need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
[Cut to London, we sit Ross sitting outside Emily’s apartment. We hear
Emily’s phone ring with amazing clarity. Apparently, sound travels quite
easily through the walls of British buildings. Anyhoo, Ross looks around for the ringing
phone and in the meantime Emily’s answering machine picks up and once again with
amazing clarity we hear Emily say…]
Emily: Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this
but… (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I’m
gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and
it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes,
Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you
that I love you.
Ross: (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all
the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the
phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
Emily: I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve
either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if
you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s
not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh
well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.
Ross: Hi.
Emily: Ross, I love you!
Ross: Ohh! Thank you.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is still watching the porn
as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she
didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Joey: Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,
gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Chandler: What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Joey: Noo! Nothing!
Chandler: Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
Joey: I think you’re right.
(Goes over and picks up the remote.)
Chandler: All right, ready?
Joey: One.
Chandler: Two.

Both: Three.
(Chandler turns off the porn and sets the remote down.)
Joey: That’s kinda nice.
Chandler: Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.
Joey: Yeah.
(Pause.)
Chandler: You wanna see if we still have it?
Joey: Yeah.
(Chandler turns on the TV and…)
Chandler: FREE PORN!!!
Joey: Yeah!!
Chandler: We have free porn here!!!
EndJoey: Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Phoebe: I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!
Alice: (entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Phoebe: Hey! What are you doing here?
Alice: Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Phoebe: Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my
uterus.
Alice: (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl
baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. 
Chandler: Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?
Alice: Don’t get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three
babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named
the other boy baby.
Phoebe: Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Alice: You think about it. (Leaves)
Opening Credits
[Scene: Ross’s apartment, he and Emily are getting ready to go to the airport.]
Emily: I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will
think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised? 
Ross: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Emily: (checks the clock) Ohh, it’s time to go.
Ross: Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17
minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Emily: Well that’s ambitious.
(They kiss but are interrupted by a knock on the door.)
Ross: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Emily: That’s Carol with your son!
Ross: Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.
Carol: (knocking on the door) Ross!
Ross: I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,
Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is
Carol and Susan.
Susan: Hey, it’s so nice to finally meet you!
Emily: Me too!
Carol: Ohh, y’know, Susan’s gonna be shooting a commercial in London
next week.
Susan: Oh yeah, I’m so excited, I’ve never been there.
Emily: Oh, well, I’ll show you around.
Susan: That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can
make any suggestions…
Emily: Oh, there’s tonnes of terrific stuff—I’ll go with you!
Susan: Ahh!
(Ross accidentally, on purpose, bumps into Susan.)
Ross: Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…
Emily: Are you all right?
Susan: Oh, he’s fine. He’s fine. It’s just that us getting along
is difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me.
Ross: Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are playing
foosball as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe: Hi!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Phoebe: Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a
book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and
confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon. 
Chandler: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Joey: Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Phoebe: No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name
starting with "The."
Joey: Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your
buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they’re hanging out with
Joey."
Chandler: Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re
gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh,
come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get
to know him.
Joey: Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if
you need him, he’ll be there.
Chandler: Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a
little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if
want you need him for is that you’re really hot.
Joey: What do ya say? What do ya say?
Phoebe: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey
and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I
don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.
Joey: I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to
name my kid!
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking and Rachel is
getting ready for a date with Joshua.]
Rachel: Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time
tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly,
lace nighties.)
Monica: Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other
people’s sex clothes.
Rachel: Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I
got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal. 
Monica: Um-hmm.
Rachel: What am I making him by the way?
Monica: Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine
nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Rachel: I thought I was making him filet mignon? 
Monica: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left
over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,
then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to
make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Rachel: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are
there as Ross enters.]
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: So uh, Emily called last night…
Chandler: And now you’re giving me the message!
Ross: Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re
going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback
riding!
Phoebe: God, Susan is so fun!
Ross: Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six
months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My
friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Chandler: You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Ross: Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!
Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t
you see Personal Best?
Joey: No, but I’m gonna!
Chandler: Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Ross: How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married
her!
Phoebe: Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.
Ross: What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.
Phoebe: No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Ross: Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?
Phoebe: Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to
like The Hulk, y’know…
Ross: Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No.
72, Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know,
ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)
Phoebe: So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or
Chandler.
Joey: Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named
Chandler.
Chandler: Raymond Chandler.
Joey: Someone you didn’t make up!
Chandler: Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey
Buttafucco.
Joey: Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Phoebe: Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like
y’know, Chanoey?
Chandler: Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll
never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.
Joey: All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is
the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely
even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right?
It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!
Chandler: Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Joey: I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m
sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.) 
Chandler: Okay.
Joey: So I guess it’s Joey then!
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on her dinner date with
Joshua.]
Joshua: This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Rachel: Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!
Joshua: Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Rachel: (taking a bite) Hmmm!
Joshua: Oh my God!
Rachel: Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.
Joshua: Behind you?
Rachel: (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to
live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Joshua: (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way
they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Rachel: Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
(Rachel gets up and ushers them into the hall, as they pass Joshua, he leaps onto the
counter to avoid them. Rachel drops them off in the hall, and knocks on Joey’s door.)
Joey: (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings
them inside.)
[Cut back to Rachel’s date.]
Rachel: All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Joshua: Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I
would’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here.
Rachel: Oh.
Joshua: So, all right.
(They both sit back down.)
Rachel: Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees
that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)
Joshua: Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out
there.
Rachel: But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it
would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Joshua: Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.
Rachel: Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I
mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.
Joshua: Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh,
I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.
Rachel: Your parents’?
Joshua: Yeah, they’re out of town.
Rachel: Ohh.
Joshua: Yeah-yeah, it’s this huge place, and-and it’s got this
gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Rachel: Yeah that works.
(He moves to kiss her, but stops when he hears the duck.)
Joshua: They-they-they can smell fear.
[Scene: Ross’s apartment, Carol has come to pick up Ben.]
Ross: (opening the door.) Hey!
Carol: Hey! How’s Ben?
Ross: Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked
him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he
said, "No." So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a
dustpan.)
Carol: Hey, Ben! Hey!
Ross: So umm, any word from Susan?
Carol: Ooh, yeah! She said she’s having sooo much fun with Emily.
Ross: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I
don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Carol: What’s too much fun?
Ross: Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Carol: Oh my God, you are so paranoid! 
Ross: Am I?!
Carol: Yes!
Ross: Am I?!
Carol: I can’t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed
relationship.
Ross: Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,
Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re
coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,
they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else…
There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there
isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Carol: Maybe.
Ross: OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!
[Scene: Joshua’s parents’ apartment, Rachel and Joshua are entering.]
Joshua: …and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to
God, that duck pushed me!
Rachel: Wow! This place is fabulous!
Joshua: Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living
room.
Rachel: Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this
place must’ve been a real babe magnet.
Joshua: Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Rachel: Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
(They kiss.)
Joshua: Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the
fridge and we can eat it later?
Rachel: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Joshua: Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your
left.
Rachel: Ah.
(She goes down the hall. Joshua goes to put the food away when his parents walk in.)
Mrs. Burgin: Oh, hi, darling!
Joshua: Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Mrs. Burgin: Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Mr. Burgin: France sucks!
Joshua: Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Mrs. Burgin: Oh, say no more!
Mr. Burgin: We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs,
and we’ll be right out of you hair.
Joshua: Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?
Mr. Burgin: Yep, sucks!
(They all go into the kitchen. Just then, Rachel comes back from the bathroom; she had
removed her dress and is wearing nothing but a lace nightie. She tries to find someplace
seductive to wait for Joshua. She tries to sit on the piano, but it makes too much noise.
So she goes over to the couch and kinda half lays down to wait for Joshua. Joshua comes in
from the kitchen, sees Rachel, and freezes.)
Rachel: Hi you!
Joshua: Oh my God!
Rachel: I know, I can do more than cook.
(Just then, his parents enter. Rachel gasps.)
Mr. Burgin: I like her. She sees smart.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Joshua’s parents’ apartment, continued from earlier.]
Joshua: Uhh, Rachel, my parents…
Rachel: Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their
hands.) Hello. 
Mr. Burgin: Hi.
Rachel: Hello.
Mrs. Burgin: Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Rachel: What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is
not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see
and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re
wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people
respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so…
And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report
back, "USA not ready."
Mrs. Burgin: Maybe in L.A?
Rachel: Yes!
Joshua: There you go.
Mr. Burgin: So, have you kids eaten yet?
Rachel: Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.
Mr. Burgin: Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something to
eat?
Rachel: Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’
around the house. 
Mr. Burgin: So… We go eat.
Rachel: Yes.
Mr. Burgin: You’ll wear that. We’ll be eating, and of course,
you’ll be wearing that.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is looking for a new
name in Phoebe’s book of names.]
Joey: Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Chandler: No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!
Joey: It’s not that bad.
Chandler: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Joey: So, you’re just Bing?
Chandler: I have no name.
Phoebe: All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Chandler: Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Joey: No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Chandler: Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Phoebe: Umm, Gene.
Chandler: It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
Joey: See you later, Gene.
Phoebe: Bye, Gene.
Chandler: It’s Clint! Clint!
Joey: What’s up with Gene?
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe and Monica of her date.]
Monica: So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Rachel: Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled
water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh, no!
Rachel: No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there
heads in agreement.)
Ross: (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she
and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! 
Rachel: So?
Ross: So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
Monica: Emily’s straight.
Ross: Oh, wake up!
Phoebe: Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Ross: Excuse me?
Phoebe: Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,
sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means,
but the rest is right.
Ross: Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy,
jealous person.
Rachel: Huh.
Ross: What?
Rachel: She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out
about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Monica: This totally makes sense!
Ross: It does not!
Monica: Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even
though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Phoebe: All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then
’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely!
Monica: This is so much fun!
Ross: This is not fun!
Monica: Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with
Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Phoebe: Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
Ross: Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Rachel: What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a
lesbian.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is showing off more of her
drum skills to Joey by rubbing one of the sticks back and forth across the drum.]
Phoebe: Drum roll.
Chandler: (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Joey: Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good
Barney.
Chandler: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down
to the courthouse.
Phoebe: You’re actually going through with this?
Chandler: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,
it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with
women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or
John Markson.
Phoebe: You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got
to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes, (To Joey) I’m, I’m sorry. I
know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m
gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.
Chandler: (pleased) Really?!
Phoebe: Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Chandler: Okay. Thanks.
Phoebe: Okay!
Chandler: You wanna hug it out?
Phoebe: Yeah!
(They both hug.)
Phoebe: Yay! 
Chandler: Yay! 
Phoebe: Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Chandler: Okay!
Phoebe: Ooh, uh… (She grabs her coat and runs out.)
Chandler: Bye, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Okay, bye! 
(She exits, and after the door is closed, Chandler turns to Joey and…)
Chandler: Ha! Ha! Ha!
Joey: Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby
Chandler.)
Closing Credits
[Scene: The Airport, Carol and Ross are waiting for Emily and Susan to deplane. A
gorgeous woman walks by and they both turn to watch her go.]
Ross: Nice luggage.
Carol: I was gonna say…
(Susan and Emily get off.)
Susan: Hey!
(They both run and hug they’re respective partners.)
Ross: Hi!
Emily: Hey! I missed you.
Ross: Oh, I missed you too.
Susan: (To Emily) Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Emily: Oh, so did I.
(They hug and give each other a little peck on the cheek.)
Ross: (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
EndChandler: Yeah we do!
Rachel: Ohh, well you got ‘em.

Both: All right!
Rachel: Just give us our apartment back!
Phoebe: Boy! I didn’t see that coming!
Chandler: Are you serious?
Rachel: Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Monica: Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?
Joey: You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.
Monica: What do you say?
Chandler: Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some
basketball seats!
Rachel: You’re bachelor pad?!
Monica: Have you even had a girl up here?
Chandler: No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Joey: Yeah, you do!
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is whining to Chandler about the tickets.]
Joey: Come on!
Chandler: (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Gunther: Good one.
Joey: Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Chandler: Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.
Joey: Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season
tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of
course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Ross: (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Joey: We don’t make enough fun of you already?
Ross: Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Chandler: You do know that Wham broke up?
Ross: I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are
you guys doing?
Joey: Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Chandler: Where is Emily?
Ross: Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
Chandler: Man, didn’t she like just get here?
Ross: Yeah!! Yeah!
Chandler: Easy tiger.
Ross: I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the
airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, "Well,
I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Chandler: So what are you going to do?
Ross: Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.
I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!
Joey: What?
Ross: I could ask her to live with me!
Chandler: Are you serious?
Ross: I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Chandler: Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got
a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!
Ross: Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she
brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?
Chandler: And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move
in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.
Joey: All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s
great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!
Ross: I don’t want to do that.
Joey: No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!
Ross: Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not,
I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)
Chandler: Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same day. Joey and
Chandler are eating pizza, and Phoebe is trying to knit something.]
Phoebe: That’s too hard. Too hard!
Monica: (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Rachel: Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Chandler: No thank you.
Joey: Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The
timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! 
Chandler: Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we
can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever
read Flowers for Algernon?
Joey: Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I
didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Chandler: Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot
more than just season seats.
Joey: It’s the Knicks!
Chandler: Screw the Knicks!
Joey: Whoa!
Chandler: I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so
much more.
Joey: Huh.
Chandler: And the Knicks rule all.
Joey: Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Phoebe: Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
Chandler: No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not
an even trade.
Rachel: All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the
tickets?
Joey: Done!
Rachel: Let me finish. 
Joey: Oh. 
Rachel: I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Joey: Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Phoebe: Or you could end up with everything.
Joey: Ooh, I like that.
Monica: All right, so what do you say?
Chandler: No!
Monica: Oh, just do it!!
Chandler: Op, op, I’m convinced!
Joey: Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best
friend.
Chandler: All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year.
I’m in.
Joey: All right!
Phoebe: Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Rachel: Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s
the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.
Phoebe: Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!
Joey: Okay! 
Chandler: Okay!
Phoebe: This is great!
Joey: What’s the game?! What’s the game?!
Phoebe: Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it
doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Monica: They’re green?
Phoebe: Good! Good! Five points!
(They both rejoice; Chandler is totally confused.)
Phoebe: All right, Joey, same question.
(He looks to Chandler, who doesn’t have a clue.)
Joey: Uhh, they’re tall.
Phoebe: Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,
leafy.
(Joey turns and is angry that Chandler didn’t come up with the answer.)
Monica: That’s not even a game!
Rachel: What? Shut up! We’re winning!
Monica: You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high
card wins. What do you say?
Chandler: Fine, let’s do it.
Phoebe: Oh, I have cards!
Joey: Oh.
Monica: Oh, good.
Phoebe: Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the
trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Chandler: Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
Chandler: That’s a low one!
Joey: Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can’t.
Phoebe: What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)
Joey: Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!
(Both Joey and Chandler and Monica and Rachel jump up and down for joy.)
Chandler: Why are you screaming and hugging?
Monica: Because we won our apartment back!
Joey: What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Monica: No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
(They all look to Phoebe to settle this.)
Phoebe: I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.)
Ah-ha!
Rachel: All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.
Joey: Okay.
Rachel: Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen
is high!
Joey: Uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) It worked! King!
Chandler: Yeah baby!
Monica: But, we pick again! We pick again!
Joey: Why?!
Monica: I don’t know!
Chandler: Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside
baby!
Joey: Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,
but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment
back!
Chandler: No they didn’t!
[Scene: Ross’s apartment, Emily has packed as Ross returns.]
Ross: Hey!
Emily: I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Ross: (laughs) Move in with me.
Emily: What?!
Ross: Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say
it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Emily: Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
Ross: I know.
Emily: My job!
Ross: Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing
about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Emily: Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life—you come to England.
Ross: No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I
can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?
Emily: Ohh, I don’t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way
into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Ross: What?
Emily: Oh no, no, right I shouldn’t have said married. Uh, please
don’t go freaky on me. I didn’t mean it. Well, I didn’t say it; I take it
back!
Ross: No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?
Emily: Why don’t we what?
Ross: Get married.
Emily: You are mad!
Ross: No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean
it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together
forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.
Emily: We’ve only known each other for six weeks!
Ross: Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me
we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married
and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.
Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I
mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?
Emily: My parents are going to be really mad.
Ross: Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Emily: Yes.
(They kiss and hug.)
Emily: Yes!
Ross: Yes! We’re getting married?!
Emily: Oh my God! 
Ross: Yes!
Emily: We’re getting married!
Ross: Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you
marry me?
Emily: Yes.
(He tries to put it on her finger.)
Emily: Ohh, it’s a bit small.
Ross: Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Emily: It was.
(They kiss.)
Commerical Break
[Scene: The hallway, Joey and Chandler are coming back from the game.]
Chandler: Those were like the best seats ever.
Joey: Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda
like a peace offering.
Chandler: Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and
they’re too small.
(He knocks on the girls’ door and walks in. Surprise! The girls, obviously using Star
Trek technology, have completely moved everything in both apartments back to their
original positions, all in the time it took for the guys to go to a basketball game. Wow!
Anyhoo, Chandler is stunned, and Joey doesn’t even realise it.)
Chandler: Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head
cut off.)
Joey: Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)
(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!
Chandler: I KNOW!!!
(They both sprint to what used to be their apartment.)
Chandler: Open up! Open up! Open up!
(A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)
Monica: We’ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)
Chandler: What the hell is going on?!
(It’s Rachel’s turn to open the door.)
Rachel: We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
Phoebe: (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)
(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.
(She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.)
Chandler: We are switching back, right now!
Monica: No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!
Chandler: Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have
jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do
to stop us! Right, Joe?
Joey: I don’t know.
Chandler: What?
Joey: I don’t want to move again! 
Chandler: I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you
stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am
getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!
(They open the door.)
Rachel: All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup
offer.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!
Rachel: Let us keep the apartment and…
Monica: As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
[Time lapse. The guys are entering their apartment.]
Chandler: Totally worth it!
Joey: That was one good minute!
Chandler: Good night.
Joey: Good night.
(They both go back into their old rooms and shut the doors. Of course, Chandler has to
close both sections of his door.)
[Cut to the girls apartment.]
Monica: Men are such idiots.
Rachel: Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our
apartment back?
Phoebe: That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after
the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Monica: Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: Okay, scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a
bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with
them Joey and Chandler.)
Ross: Come on! Come on. Come on.
Chandler: Okay!
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Monica: What-what’s going on?
Joey: Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Ross: Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
(The gang is stunned.)
Phoebe: What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Emily: Umm, no.
Monica: When, when did—how, how did you…
Ross: We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Emily: I mean, we know it’s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right,
so…
(Rachel slowly walks in from her bedroom. She is stunned speechless.)
Ross: (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…
Rachel: Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for
Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I’m so happy for
you!
(Seeing Rachel’s apparently okay with this, the rest of the gang jumps up to
congratulate Ross and Emily on their pending nuptials.) 
Chandler: Oh, well, that’s great!
Joey: Yeah! Yeah!
Monica: (to Ross) I can’t believe you’re getting married! 
Ross: Yeah. (They hug again.)
Joey: Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at
him.)
Closing Credits
[Scene: Joey’s bedroom, he is awoken by the singing guy.]
The Singing Man: (singing) Morning’s here! The morning’s here! 
(Joey joins him.)

Both: Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning’s here!
The Singing Man: Hey! You’re back!
Joey: Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!
The Singing Man: (singing) Breakfast is near!

Both: The dark of night has disappeared!!
The Singing Man: I’ll see you tomorrow morning!
Joey: (happily) Okay!
EndRoss: Yep!
Rachel: In a month?
Ross: Yeah!
Rachel: You mean, you mean 30 days?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: From now? 
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Well, that’s great.
Ross: Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place
that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I
know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t
know, this just feels right. Y’know?
Joey: (still looking in date book) Hey! That’s the day after I stop
menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn’t mine.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is waiting impatiently for Joshua.]
Joshua: (entering) Hey, Rachel.
Rachel: Hi!
Joshua: What’s up? You’re voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Rachel: Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him)
See you.
Joshua: Great!
Rachel: Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
Joshua: (sitting) You okay?
Rachel: I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Joshua: Do I?
Rachel: ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are
so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are
clicking. Y’know?
Joshua: Yeah, sure-sure, yeah,
we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re clicking.
Rachel: Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where
I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was
we’re just not crazy enough!
Joshua: I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I’m not too sure I agree with that.
Rachel: Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we
no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean, I mean
like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound
y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got
married?
Joshua: What?! (Gunther is listening in.)
Rachel: Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like,
"Whoa! Can we do this?" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!
Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?
Joshua: Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you’re a real special lady, but my divorce
isn’t final yet and, and, and we’ve been on four days, so I’m thinking
"No, but thanks."
Gunther: YOU IDIOT!!!!!
[Scene: The Sleep Clinic, Joey is having trouble staying awake.]
Sleep Clinic Worker: Your name, please?
Joey: Joey Tribbiani.
Sleep Clinic Worker: Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for
your sleep study. (Joey doesn’t answer) Uh, sir? (Joey starts snoring)
Chandler: (answering for him) Yes he did.
Sleep Clinic Worker: Alll right, we’ll call you in a few minutes.
(As she leaves, a beautiful woman enters and sits down across from the boys.)
Chandler: (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Joey: (sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you
doin’?
(Chandler wakes him up, again.)
Joey: What?!
Chandler: You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a
stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.)
I’m Chandler.
Woman: I’m Marjorie.
Chandler: Hi.
Marjorie: Hi.
Chandler: You mind if I…
Marjorie: No, please. 
(He sits down next to her.)
Chandler: So uh, what are you in for?
Marjorie: I talk in my sleep.
Chandler: What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
Joey: (asleep) So why don’t you give me your number?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe, still defying reality, are now throwing
a bouquet at each other, pretending to catch the actual bouquet at an actual
wedding.]
Monica: Okay, ready?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Monica: Okay.
(She turns around and throws the bouquet to Phoebe.)
Phoebe: (catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)
Monica: Congratulations!
Phoebe: Thank you!
Monica: Okay! My turn! My turn!
Phoebe: Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?
Monica: (cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual)
Yeah.
Phoebe: Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
Monica: (upset) That was a terrible throw!!
Phoebe: I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!
Monica: Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! (Finally realises) Oh
my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?
Phoebe: Yeah, I think we are.
Monica: This isn’t even my dress.
Phoebe: Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called,
"It’s Not Too Late."
Monica: I’m changing out of this.
Phoebe: Me too.
Monica: In like a half-hour?
Phoebe: Me too.
Monica: Okay, throw it straight this time.
Phoebe: Okay.
(She throws it straight, and Monica makes a big deal about catching it.)
Monica: I’m getting married next!!
Phoebe: Yay!
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe, back to reality, are sitting in normal
clothes.]
Phoebe: I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I
know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.
Monica: Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start
feeling silly?
Phoebe: I guess.
(Monica crosses her legs and is still wearing the garter belt.)
Phoebe: Oh my God! 
Monica: Oh God.
Phoebe: Oh, you’re such a cheater!
Chandler: (entering) Hello! Little ones.
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Chandler: Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re
stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Phoebe: Oh, how’d that happen?
Chandler: Because I’m cooler.
Monica: No, seriously.
Chandler: Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious. 
(Joey enters, wearing a mouth guard like boxers wear.)
Joey: (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: What is that?
Joey: (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna
help me not to snore.
Monica: Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you
have to wear it unless you are!
Joey: (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good.
(Puts it back in.)
Chandler: Plus, you look cool.
(Joey totally agrees with this statement and kicks his feet up.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is putting away the wedding dress, finally.]
Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…
Phoebe: Oh, how did it go?
Rachel: Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl
who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.
Phoebe: What did he say?
Rachel: Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I
feel blue.
Monica: Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that
he’s gonna call you again.
Rachel: Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think
he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally
okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling
it all that well.
Phoebe: Yeah, maybe.
Rachel: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Phoebe: Any luck?
Rachel: Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on
again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on
again.
Monica: Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress into
Rachel’s room.)
Ross: So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,
Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?
Rachel: Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Ross: Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.
Rachel: Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.
Ross: What happened?
Rachel: Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Ross: Noo. Why?
Rachel: Well, apparently he scares easy.
Ross: Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.
Rachel: It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d
thought they would.
Ross: Come here.
(They hug.)
Rachel: (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: You okay?
Rachel: Yeah! I got my girls.
(He leaves.)
Rachel: Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)
Phoebe: (looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?
Rachel: What?
[Time lapse, all three girls are now wearing wedding dresses, eating popcorn, drinking
beer, and watching TV.]
Rachel: Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Monica: Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)
Maybe someday, there will be.
(There’s a knock on the door.)
Monica: Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big
date!
Rachel: Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)
Monica: No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!
Phoebe: No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Rachel: I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
Phoebe: Not after this!
Rachel: Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she
does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the
door.)
Joshua: I gotta go.
Rachel: Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that
oughta do it.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Chandler’s bedroom, he is sleeping with Marjorie. All of the sudden,
Marjorie starts talking in her sleep, awakening Chandler. After a little bit, she quiets
back down, and Chandler tries to get back to sleep. There’s a short pause until she
starts screaming, causing Chandler to scream with her. She quickly calms down. This all
wakes up Joey, who comes over wearing the mouth guard, opens the top half of
Chandler’s door, and starts to complain about the noise.]
Joey: (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to
say, "What’s up with that?")
EndMonica: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Chandler: Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
[cut to later]
Monica: Oh, dad, turn it off.
Mr. Geller: It is off.  Right Ross? (pans over to see Ross with
an afro and moustache)
Joey: Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
[cut to later]
Rachel: I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too
late.
Monica: If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Mrs. Geller: (to Ross on the stairs) I have a wonderful idea. You
should take Rachel to the prom.
[cut to later]
Ross: Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
All: No, no, no.
Ross: OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Mr. Geller: C'mon kid, let's go.
Mrs. Geller: Ahh, are you hadsome.
Mr. Geller: Let's show 'em.
Ross: (walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on
the endtable) Okay dad.
Mr. Geller: (going downstairs) Rachel, ready or not, here comes your
knight in shining—Oh no. (Chip has shown up and the four are leaving.)
Rachel, Monica, Roy, and Chip: Bye.
Mrs. Geller: Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Monica: (to Ross) I can't believe you did that.
Ross: Yeah, well.
[Rachel, seeing what he did for her, gets up, walks across the room, and kisses Ross]
Phoebe: See, he's her lobster.
[Cut back to the present, Rachel has made her decision.]
Monica: (seeing the decision) Nooooo. You’re really not going?
Rachel: Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s
Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best,
y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here
with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to
help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Monica: You don’t have a car. And your license expired. 
Rachel: I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have
so little time to do it in.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do
whilst in London.]
Chandler: All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that
there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the
book.) "It’s almost as good as being there."
Joey: It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
Chandler: Well, You could, but... probably just the one
time.
Joey: I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our
hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Chandler: If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Joey: Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
End[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross’s bachelor party. Ross is thanking Joey for the
party.]
Ross: Hey listen man, about the stripper…
Joey: Yeah?
Ross: Good call!
Chandler: (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement,
a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Gunther: What’s my last name?
Chandler: Central Perk?
Gunther: (to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)
Joey: Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don’t-don’t forget your shirt. (He gives
Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)
Ross: Hey-hey, what are those?
Joey: Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It’s a shirt that reads,
"Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998")
Ross: Wow! Yeah!
Joey: Oh-oh! (Shows him what’s on the back, "Best Man Joey Tribbiani,
with a huge picture of him.)
Chandler: (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I
just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the
stripper) so is the position of the bride.
The Stripper: Great!
Ross: Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and
runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great.
And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.
Joey: Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt.
Ross: Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
Joey: Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice
lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit
and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out!
Here you go. All right.
The Stripper: Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Joey: Yeah!
The Stripper: Wow, I didn’t know they let you keep chickens and ducks as
pets.
Joey: Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the
wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck
complies.)
The Stripper: You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw
one hell of a party.
Joey: Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my
friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…
The Stripper: Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Joey: Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
The Stripper: Yeah?
Joey: Yeah. I’ll let you play with my duck.
[Scene: Joey’s bedroom, it’s the middle of the night, he’s waking up and
discovers he’s alone in bed.]
Joey: Hey, (realises he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that
the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it’s continued from earlier. Joey is now waking
Chandler and telling him the news.]
Joey: (running and banging on Chandler’s door) The stripper stole the
ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper
stole the ring!
Chandler: (opening the door) What?
Joey: The ring is gone!
Chandler: Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!!
You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!
Joey: Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,
everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is
gone!
Chandler: You slept with the stripper?
Joey: Of course!! (Shrugs.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is entering, Monica and Rachel are talking on the couch.]
Phoebe: Hi, guys.
Rachel: Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)
Monica: Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe: I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy
yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.
Rachel: No we…
Monica: Hormones.
Rachel: …hormones, yeah.
Phoebe: Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
Monica: Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how
are things going?
Phoebe: Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like
everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?
Rachel: Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to
Ross’s wedding.
Phoebe: Oh!
Rachel: It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
Phoebe: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street
and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Rachel: Well, h-how is this like that?
Phoebe: Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see
that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of
y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
Rachel: (starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…
Phoebe: Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is trying to figure out what to do.]
Joey: Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company
that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this
isn’t an emergency, then what is?
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey…
Ross: I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And
the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor
party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…
Joey: So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!
Ross: Yeah, right!
Joey: I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for
myself, I might want to get one of those…
Ross: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and
the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Chandler: So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little
squeeze.)
Ross: Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride
who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Chandler: So you might say, it’s a magic ring.
Joey: (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Ross: My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Chandler: Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why
don’t you be my best man."
Ross: (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the
cops!
Joey: Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!
Ross: Not on you! On the stripper!
Joey: Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into
it right after they solved all the murders.
Ross: Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!
Joey: I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number.
They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police." I said,
"If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!"
Ross: So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s
nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Joey: Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…
Chandler: Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her
come to my office?
Joey: Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are cautiously serving Phoebe some tea.]
Monica: Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a
step back.)
Phoebe: (sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of
relief.) Oh, thanks.
Rachel: Good.
Monica: I’m so glad you liked it.
Phoebe: (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
Monica: What?!
Rachel: What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
Phoebe: Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Rachel: You what?
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that
was definitely one.
Monica: Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t
sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Rachel: Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what?
It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just
rip up some sheets!
Phoebe: No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said
that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Monica: Rachel, get the book! The book!
Rachel: Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
Monica: The Bible?!
Rachel: I don’t know!
[Scene: Chandler’s office, the guys are there waiting to ambush the stripper.]
Joey: All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would
she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll
be uh, Mr. Wong.
Ross: Diverse.
(There’s a knock on the door.)
The Stripper: Did anybody call for security?
Chandler: (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all
turn there backs on her.)
The Stripper: Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)
Hey, Joey?
Ross: Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is
it? Where is it?
Chandler: Way to be cool, man.
The Stripper: What’s he talking about?
Joey: There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
The Stripper: Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?

The Guys: Yeah!
Ross: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
The Stripper: Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need to
steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys
make that?
Chandler: Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do,
since their plan with the stripper backfired on them.]
Joey: I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t
take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did?
(The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the
same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck
still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is recovering from her false labour.]
Rachel: I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.
Phoebe: Well, do you see any babies?
Monica: How do you feel?
Phoebe: Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I
know it’s going to be over soon.
Rachel: Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Phoebe: I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when
you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing.
I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Monica: Some moms do that.
Phoebe: Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself
into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I
know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little
babies have to go away.
Monica: Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have
anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even
better.
Phoebe: Yeah, okay.
Rachel: No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying
about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or
deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?
Monica: I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna
run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Rachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Phoebe: Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Phoebe: They are gonna love me.
Rachel: Oh!
Phoebe: Thanks you guys! Again.
Monica: Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)
Phoebe: You’re the best. Thanks. Oh! 

Monica and Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: Just kidding. Ahh!
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
[Scene: The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring. Joey
is pacing around like an expectant father.]
Joey: If anything should happen to him…
Ross: Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
Joey: So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make
it?!
Chandler: He will, Joe.
Joey: Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.
(With that we go into a little flashback about the guys’ memories of the duck. The
first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. Then it’s
Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler
reading to him in bed, and him watching Baywatch when all they had was the canoe
and the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck
watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it’s Chandler
shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls’ apartment, Joey revealing their disco
cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them,
and it’s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it’s wings. And
the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)
Joey: I’m so worried about him, y’know?
The Doctor: (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?
Ross: Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,
and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)
Joey: H-h-h-how’s the duck?
The Doctor: He’s doing just fine, he’s resting now, but you can see
him in a little bit.
Joey: Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Ross: No, that’s all right.
Joey: No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let
you down!
Chandler: Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.
Joey: Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know
what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.
Chandler: No, you should.
Joey: Now, don’t argue with me…
Ross: Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you
guys. 
Chandler: Really?
Joey: Really?
Ross: Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are
my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting
emotional.)
Chandler: Thanks man.
Joey: (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so
that they can’t see him cry.)
Chandler: What a baby.
Ross: Total wuss!
(They both turn and wipe their eyes.)
Closing Credits
[There was no closing scene, only a preview of the wedding.]
EndPhoebe: Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.

Housekeeper: This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is
not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks
for the person with whom one wishes to speak.

Phoebe: (In a British accent) This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if
it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Housekeeper: Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it’s not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

Phoebe: No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the
number for where they are?

Housekeeper: I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.

Phoebe: Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn
somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come
over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.

Housekeeper: Hangs up.

Phoebe: Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.

Very nice to meet you. (Looking over at his wife.) Darling it’s the Gellers. (She
pays no attention she’s talking on a cellular phone.) (Louder) Darling, it’s the
Gellers. (She’s still not responding.) She’s very self-absorbed, you know. I
should never have married her.

Mrs. Waltham: (Looking evilly at her husband) Sorry, what?

Mr. Waltham: It’s the Gellers!

Mrs. Waltham: Where?

Mr. Waltham: Well there’s one (pointing towards Jack) and there’s another

Mrs. Waltham: Lovely to meet you.

Mr. Waltham: Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding. (He hand a
multipage bill to Jack.)

Mr. Geller: Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we’re happy to do it.

Mrs. Geller: We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only
wedding we get to throw (patting Monica on the shoulder.).

Monica: Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries.
(Ross quickly directs the families to their tables.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey are standing by the kitchen entrance. A waiter comes out.]

Waiter: Sir? (Looking at Joey.)

Joey: What’s in it?

Waiter: Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta. (Joey Looks down disgustingly
at the food.)

Joey: (Looking up at the waiter)That’s not food...No, I don’t, no...(Taps
Chandler on the shoulder.) Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my
family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Chandler: Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,
Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.

Joey: (Pointing  at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England.
(Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.)
[Camera pans to the Geller family table. Ross, Rachel, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there.]

Mr. Geller: (Looking at ht wedding bill.) What the hell!!!

Ross: what’s up, Dad?

Mr. Geller: This bill for my half of the wedding. it’s insane.

Mrs. Geller: How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.

Mr. Geller: (Pointing items out on the bill.) Flowers, liquor, recarpet first
floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I’m paying to remodel this guys house. (Angrily
gets up.) I’m going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.

Ross: (Holding him back.)Dad, dad, please. Look I don’t want anything to upset
Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks up the
bill.) Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?

Mr. Geller: And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.

Mrs. Geller: Ooh, Jack....(He looks over to her) Sometimes I forget how powerful
you can be. (They embrace and kiss passionately.)

Monica: (Looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) And I’m going to go get
drunk. (Gets up to get a drink.)
[Scene: An airport in New York.]

Rachel: (Running to the ticket counter) Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. (Slightly out of
breath) Hi.

Ticket Agent: (Cheerfully.) Hello.

Rachel: (Faking cheerfulness.) Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?

Ticket Agent: (looking at her computer terminal) There’s one leaving in thirty
minutes.

Rachel: Ohh, good.

Ticket Agent: And I do have one seat left. 

Rachel: Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Ticket Agent: The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.

Rachel: (looking through her wallet.) Ohh, I just don’t think I have enough
left on my credit card.

Ticket Agent: Well you can split it with another credit card.

Rachel: Ohh, okay, how about five. (She hands her all the credit cards.) Ohh, thank
you.

Ticket Agent: I’m just going to need to see your passport.

Rachel: (Looking through her purse.) Okay, you know what? I don’t have it, but
I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I
have my drivers license and I have a twenty. (She slides it across the counter.)

Ticket Agent: (Slides the twenty back and tosses her credit card onto the counter.)
[Scene: The Rehearsal dinner hall. Ross is at the Walthams’ table discussing the
bill.]

Ross: Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and
believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.

Mr. Waltham: Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.

Ross: I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face.

Mrs. Waltham: This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. (Ross looks
frustrated. She begins to scream at her husband.) Will you say something, Steven?!
Please!!!

Mr. Waltham: Don’t take that tone with me. (She looks evilly at him.) All-all
right you can. (He looks over at Ross and Shrugs.)
[Scene: The Girls apartment. Phoebe is dialing the phone and Rachel runs in the door.]

Rachel: (Running to her room.) Hi, Pheebs.

Phoebe: (Looking relieved. She puts down the phone.) Oh thank god. Oh, you changed
your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don’t want to talk
about it, that’s fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing
and...

Rachel: (Running back out the door with her passport.) Bye, Pheebs.

Phoebe: (Trying to get up.) Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!!
Wait!! (Not able to get up.) God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
[Scene: The Rehearsal Dinner Hall. Chandler, Joey, Ross, Emily, Monica, and all the
bridal party are seated at the table. Chandler gets up to make a toast.]

Chandler: I’d like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be
tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will.
(No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long
time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks
embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over
inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear
God.. (A cellular phone rings.)

Mrs. Waltham: Hello, Waltham Interiors.

Phoebe: Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or
Ross’s sister Monica.

Mrs. Waltham: Who is this?

Phoebe: Oh, I’m Phoebe Buffay. I’m one of Ross’s best friends.

Mrs. Waltham: Well, if you’re on e of Ross’s best friends, why
aren’t you here?

Phoebe: Yeah, um, I can’t fly. I’m having my brother’s babies.

Mrs. Waltham: Oh, am I on the radio?

Phoebe: No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It’s very very important.

Mrs. Waltham: No, I’m bored with you now. I’m going to cut you off. (She
hangs up.)

Phoebe: Ohh! Okay, I’m going to have to kick her ass too.

Chandler: (Continuing his toast.) And I’m sure we’re all very excited
that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend

Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and
Emily. (He sits down.)

Joey: Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I’m not good with the
jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy
couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where
everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as
much as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now?
(One of the bridesmaids, Felicity, puts her arm around Joey.)

know you better.

Joey: (Putting his arm around her.) I’m not going anywhere, sweetheart.
[Scene: Later that evening at the rehearsal dinner. Chandler and Monica are sitting on
a sofa. Chandler is covering his face in embarrassment because of the toast.]

Monica: I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)

Chandler: Out loud?

Monica: Well I didn’t want everyone to think I was stupid.

Chandler: So how are you doing?

Monica: My mother’s driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I’m
happy. (A drunken man approaches.) I’m not going to let anything spoil that.

Drunk Man: I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.

Monica: Well, thanks, we like him.

Drunk Man: My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him. (Monica stares
straight forward after the comment. Chandler tries to console her by patting her on the
shoulder.)
(Ross and Emily’s parents are seated at a table. Ross is between them and they are
discussing the wedding bill.)

Mr. Geller: There’s no way in hell, I’m paying for it.

Ross: Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it
after the wedding.

Mr. Geller: All-right fine, but I just want to say, I’m not paying for your
wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren’t for us, cheap
little man. (Emily’s stepmum looks shocked. Jack and Judy get up and leave.)
(Chandler’s trying to console Monica.)

Chandler: The guy was hammered, okay? There’s no way, you look like
Ross’s mother.

Monica: Then why would he say it?

Chandler: Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me
for my very moving performance in Titanic.

Monica: Oh, my mother’s right. I’m never going to get married.

Chandler: Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?

Monica: Ohh, Please?! I’m a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!

Rachel: Hi, I’m back. Listen, I need to...

Ticket Agent: Oh I’m afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.

Rachel: Okay, you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell
them to swing around and come and pick me up.

Ticket Agent: I can’t do that.

Rachel: Sure, you know what? Come on, we’ll just tell them that there was like
a problem with like the "engine".

Ticket Agent: I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to step aside,
Miss.

Rachel: Look, If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other
girl!!!

Ticket Agent: I can’t imagine why.

Rachel: All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane

Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way

Passenger: (Frustrated he takes his headphones off.) Oh, oh oh!! I’m sorry,
can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.

Rachel: Ehh, pardon me?

Passenger: You say you love this man, yet you’re about to ruin the happiest

is a...terrible, terrible plan.

Passenger: But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.

Rachel: (Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.

Mrs. Geller: I just hope...

Monica: (Angrily.) You can let some of them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the front
of the chapel. Joey approaches Monica.)

Joey: (Whispering.) Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for
Rachel. I’ll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the
building and I got Chandler covering Ross.

Monica: (Awkwardly.) Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know
sometimes I don’t even like Chandler.

Joey: Okay. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.)
(Ross and chandler are standing next to the alter. Ross is practicing for the wedding.)

the middle of your ass.

Ross: Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)

Emily: What-what’s going on?!

Ross: Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.

Mr. Geller: Okay, okay.

Mr. Waltham: Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. (Them all walk away. As he leaves
he mutters to Jack.) I could kill you with my thumb, you know.

Emily: What was all that about?

Ross: (Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in
her wedding dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.

Emily: (Giggles.) Ohh...(She realizes that she’s in her gown.) Oh! You were
not meant to see me before the wedding. It’s bad luck.

Ross: You know what, I think we’ve had all the bad luck we’re going to
have. (He hugs her.)
(The front entrance. Joey and the bridesmaid are up against the wall kissing. Rachel
comes in the door and walks by Joey unnoticed. She walks into the chapel and sees Ross and
Emily kissing. She looks as though she wants to cry. Emily walks away and Ross turns and
sees Rachel standing there.)

cheek.) Your here. I can’t believe it. (She giggles.) What happen? Why are you here?

Rachel: Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. She’s almost in
tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.)
Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the tears.)
[Scene: Camera fades to one of the band members playing guitar at the wedding. The

Mrs. Waltham: (Throws her head back in disgust.) Why?!

Phoebe: Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is
going to be the last time I promise.

Mrs. Waltham: (Slapping the phone into Joey’s chest.) Joey there’s a girl
on the phone for you.

Joey: (Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to
escort her down the aisle.)

Joey: No, but it’s okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.

Phoebe: So nothing got ruined?

Joey: No.

Phoebe: Oh that’s so great! Ohh, so what’s going on now?

Joey: Ah, I’m-I’m walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham
takes her place.) I’m about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night.
(Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her "Hey." And now
I’m at the front with Ross. It’s Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks
pretty mad. Uh...I’d better go.

Phoebe: No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks
at Ross and holds the phone above Ross’s shoulder.)
(Chandler escorts Monica down the aisle.)

Chandler: What we did last night was....

Monica: Stupid.

Chandler: Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)

Monica: What were we thinking?

Chandler: I’m coming over tonight though, right?

Monica: Oh yeah. Definitely.
(They quickly take their places and Here Comes the Bride Begins to play. Everyone
seated looks back. Emily is being escorted up the aisle by her father. She kisses him on
the cheek and takes her place by Ross’s side.)

Minister: Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union
of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now
Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...

Emily: I, Emily...

Minster: Take thee Ross...

Emily: Take thee Ross...

Minster: As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts
us.

Emily: As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts
us.

Minster: Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...

Ross: I Ross...

Minister: Take thee, Emily...

Ross: Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He
realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.

Minister: (Looking and feeling awkward. he looks towards Emily.) Uhh...Shall I go
on? 
(Rachel looks all around as if all the eyes in the chapel were looking at her as the
picture fades to black.)

Closing Credits
EndMonica: Maybe I could do it.
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Joey: Hi, Rach.
Chandler: Hi!
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Rachel: Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but
y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about
it. All right?
Joey: I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right
back there. (Points over his shoulder.)
Rachel: That's not Ross!
Phoebe: Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Chandler: Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Rachel: Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Joey: Hey, you're not Kip!
Rachel: (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?
Joey: Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?
Chandler: Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Joey: Oh, that poor bastard.
Rachel: See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up
they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay
his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Monica: You're not gonna be phased out!
Rachel: Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.
(To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before
someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Phoebe: Ehh!!
Rachel: Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right
out.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV.]
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an
eyelash curler in your room.
Chandler: Yes that was mine.
Joey: 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Chandler: Yes that would have made more sense.
Joey: Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,
I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were
you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on couch and Rachel is getting some coffee.
Phoebe keeps turning her head from to keep from looking at Rachel.]
Rachel: Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole
lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!
Phoebe: Come where?
Rachel: Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're
the best ones.
Phoebe: Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Ross: (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Phoebe: Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his
back.) Forever.
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Ross: I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the
one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Rachel: Oh, Ross…
Ross: No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey
at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Rachel: No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Ross: Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you
do?
Rachel: Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Ross: I can't believe this is happening.
Rachel: I know.
Ross: I am so sorry.
Rachel: I know that too.
Joey: (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry
to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is doing a crossword puzzle.]
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hi.
Chandler: I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda
sucked, huh?
Monica: Yeah, it did.
Chandler: So, I guess this is over.
Monica: What?
Chandler: Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Monica: Why, exactly?
Chandler: Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Monica: Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with
someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize something
there.)
Chandler: So, this isn't over?
Monica: (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and
move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Chandler: Really? Okay. Great!
Monica: Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)
Chandler: (stops her) We're in a relationship?
Monica: I'm afraid so.
Chandler: Okay.
(They kiss.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are there as Phoebe
enters.]
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Monica: Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
(Joey thinks that sounds familiar, but dismisses the thought.)
Monica: Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Rachel: Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)
(Joey puts two and two together.)
Joey: (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Chandler: Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag
Joey into Monica's room.)
Joey: Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
(Chandler pushes him through the door and Monica closes it behind them.)
[Cut to Monica's room, Chandler tackles Joey onto her bed and tries to cover his
mouth.]
Joey: Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Chandler: Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
Joey: (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Monica: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Joey: How?! When?!
Chandler: It happened in London.
Joey: IN LONDON!!!

Chandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.
Joey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
(They both grab him and stop him.)
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell.
(Joey thinks it over.)
Joey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…
Monica: I know, it's great!
(She goes over and kisses Chandler.)
Joey: Aww, I don't want to see that!
[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel.]
Phoebe: We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to
take Joey!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Ross are playing Madlibs. Phoebe is
reading hers.]
Phoebe: The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if
you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Monica: Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Phoebe: Count for what?
Monica: Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
(They putting their notepads down and get up to leave.)
Joey: I guess I'm done.
Chandler: Fun's over!
Monica: Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means
something!
Rachel: Uh-huh!
Joey: I think I'm gonna take-off.
Monica: Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and
close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)
EndMonica: Sorry.
Chandler: Sorry.
(They wait for Joey to go into his room and close the door and then start making out
again.)
Joey: (from the bedroom) I can hear that!
Monica: (To Chandler) Rachel's at work.
(They both go to her apartment.)
(Pause.)
Joey: I can still hear you!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are there as Phoebe enters carrying a
large box.]
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hello!
Monica: Hey, what's that?
Phoebe: Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my
grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have
heirlooms for crying out loud.
(She puts her leg up on the chair and removes this huge knife from her boot to open the
box with. The guys are shocked at the knife's existence.)
Phoebe: Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a
fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)
Joey: Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Phoebe: Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but
at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Chandler: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers
bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)
That didn't happen, I made that up!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Gunther: Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Ross: How come? Everybody else does.
Gunther: You can't.
Monica: What is that?
Ross: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Monica: (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.
Ross: Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all
new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Monica: So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Ross: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Gunther: I'll take it all.
Joey: Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Ross: Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine.
Chandler: Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Ross: After what I did? Can you blame her?
Phoebe: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said
someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
(Ross suddenly gets up and heads for the bathroom.)
Joey: (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's
furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Monica: Now calm down Joey.
Joey: No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see
Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Phoebe: Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Chandler: Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…
Monica: Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's
happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you
cool with that?
Joey: No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
[Scene: The Storage Room in the basement of Monica and Rachel's building, Monica and
Rachel are looking for something.]
Rachel: Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please
hurry up honey! Please? 
Monica: Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait
until I find the little waffle iron.
Rachel: I want the little round waffles.
Monica: All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the
can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is
underneath the can of poison?
(The single light flickers and goes out. Leaving the room in total darkness.)
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
(She starts to run out but is stopped by a figure looming out of the darkness carrying
a pick axe.)
Rachel: Arghhhh!!!!!!
(They both start screaming at the top of their lungs.)
Monica: Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
(Rachel grabs the bug bomb, activates it, throws it at the figure, and they both run
out through the fog.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]
Phoebe: I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Joey: I'll take it!
Phoebe: That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
Joey: Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,
what do you think?
Chandler: You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. 
Ross: (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.
Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Joey: What's the matter Ross?
Ross: Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and
it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Phoebe: Why?
Ross: Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh
new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on
one side and Columbia on the other.
Joey: That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)
Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Chandler: So you're really okay with this?
Ross: Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get
so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Chandler: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.
We should get them together and make a continuum.
(Ross exits.)
Joey: Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him
again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!
(Monica and Rachel enter breathless.)
Rachel: You guys! You guys!
Monica: We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy
man!
Rachel: It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a
bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Monica: And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Rachel: (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his
yeti ass!
Joey: Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Rachel: Yeah!
Joey: Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Rachel: Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Joey: Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this
four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. 
Monica: Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we
fog!
[Scene: Their Building, Monica and Rachel are going to apologize to Danny. Rachel
knocks on his door, which he opens and he has this really bushy beard and long hair.
Picture Paul Bunyan.]
Danny: Yeah?
Rachel: Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged
you.
Monica: We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Danny: Okay. 
(He closes the door. Rachel's not happy with that and knocks again. He opens the door.)
Rachel: Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought
you were like a yeti or something.
Danny: Okay.
(He closes the door again. Once again, Rachel knocks (harder this time) and he answers
it.)
Danny: Yesss?
Rachel: Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your
acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Monica: Yeah.
Danny: O-kay!
(He closes the door before Rachel can say anything.)
Monica: Wow! That guy is so rude!
Rachel: Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Monica: Well you did a little bit.
Rachel: Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Monica: I totally forgive you!
Rachel: Really?
Monica: Yes!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is making a drink as Phoebe enters with the fur
coat.]
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? 
Monica: Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Phoebe: He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,
bring in the next person I know who dies.
(Rachel enters from the bathroom and sees the coat.)
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Monica: Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Rachel: What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big
kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a
crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
Phoebe: This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death
is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's
Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps
of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the
mirror.) 'Cause I do.
[Scene: Ross's Apartment, the gang is helping Ross move out by carrying boxes. Chandler
has picked a particularly large and apparently heavy box, because he takes a running start
at it and still can't budge it.]
Ross: (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.
Bye. (Hangs up.)
Chandler: Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Ross: No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Chandler: So, rocks. 
(He picks up a smaller box and carries it to the moving van as Joey returns.)
Ross: I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps
right over there. (Points.)
Joey: Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off
the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Ross: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Joey: Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Ross: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…
Joey: You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are
you, are you crazy?!
Ross: Why?
Joey: It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters
behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys
said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told
me that he's not entirely happy.
Ross: What's going on?
Joey: We all hate Emily!
Phoebe: Nooo!!
Monica: No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're
having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Joey: Yeah!
Chandler: Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Joey: Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Ross: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys
gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right,
it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all
laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real
life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
Phoebe: I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are recovering from Ross's
rebuke.]
Monica: God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Phoebe: Oh, I know.
Joey: I kinda feel like it's my fault.
(Monica and Chandler turn and stare at him.)
Chandler: Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've
happened.
Joey: Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound
to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)
Chandler: Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
(Monica pats Joey on the shoulder.)
Phoebe: All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on
her fur coat.)
Chandler: Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal
rights thing?
Phoebe: Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very
nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had
wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to
Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
[Scene: Their building's lobby, Danny is checking his mailbox as Rachel enters carrying
shopping bags and goes to her mailbox. Danny has shaved his beard and cut his hair, Rachel
doesn't recognize him.]
Rachel: Hi!
Danny: So you like the short hair better.
Rachel: What? Yeti—I mean Danny?
Danny: I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Rachel: Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know
if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.
Danny: Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
Rachel: (shocked) What?
Danny: That's cool. Cool. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel: What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Danny: Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog. 
Rachel: So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!
Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Danny: Do you?
Rachel: Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Danny: Okay. (Heads for his apartment.)
Rachel: And stop saying that! I hate that!
Danny: Okay!
(Rachel decides not to give up that easily and follows him to his apartment and bangs
on the door, which he opens.)
Rachel: Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you
are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up
your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Danny: The pizza-place across the street any good?
Rachel: What?!
Danny: I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Rachel: Okay. Okay.
Danny: Stop saying that. I hate that.
[Scene: Ross's now empty apartment, he is spackling some holes shut as the gang comes
to apologize.]
Chandler: Uh, Ross?
Phoebe: Are you still mad at us?
Ross: Yep.
Phoebe: Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Ross: Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Joey: Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff
and I just acted like a jerk.
Chandler: Yeah, we are so sorry.
Phoebe: (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play
but is stopped by…)
Joey: Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Monica: Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Phoebe: Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Ross: Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Phoebe: Yes! Exactly! And that's why…
(She starts to play her song, but is stopped by Monica.)
Monica: Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Ross: Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Phoebe: Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a
seeing-eye dog coat!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Rachel, are getting ready for dinner.]
Joey: Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Ross: You do, huh?
Joey: Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions
right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes
like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander
around, you're alone…
Ross: What are you talking about?
Joey: (thinks) I'm not sure.
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Monica: Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Rachel: Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Monica: How did that happen?
Rachel: That yeti is one smooth talker.
Monica: I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Rachel: Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
All: No! Why?
Rachel: Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you
with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.
Ross: Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would
really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Rachel: Ross, I…
Joey: RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!

Rachel: Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Joey: All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…
[Time lapse, dinner is now finished and Ross is looking out the window.]
Ross: Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
(They all run over to the window.)
Rachel: I haven't seen him in so long!
Phoebe: Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
(Pause.)
Monica: Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll
all be hanging out together.
Joey: It's almost as if he knew.
(The phone rings.)
Monica: I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh
you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)
Ross: Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,
sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
(Ross puts her on speakerphone.)
Phoebe: Hi Emily!
Chandler: Hi!
Emily: Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Joey: Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure
who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Emily: (laughs) Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
(Rachel waves her hands in disgust and starts to head for her room.)
Ross: Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
Emily: She's there?!
Chandler: Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Ross: Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Emily: Ross, take me off speakerphone.
(He does so.)
Ross: (on phone) Hi.
Emily: How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear!
Ross: (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,
okay?
Emily: You obviously can't keep away from her.
Ross: Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends
out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll
see you're the only person I want to be with.
Emily: I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the
time.
Ross: Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never
gonna work if you don't trust me.
Emily: You're right.
Ross: So, can you trust me?
(Pause.)
Emily: No.
(Ross lowers his head.)
[Cut to the inside of the apartment.]
Joey: I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Monica: How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Joey: You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his
back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera
cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey
alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back
inside.)
Ross: Well, I guess that's it.
All: Why, what happened?
Joey: What happened? What happened?
Ross: My marriage is over.
All: What?!
Monica: Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Phoebe: Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
Rachel: Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Ross: Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Ending Credits
[Scene: A curbside newsstand, Phoebe is whistling and walking up to it wearing her fur
coat. She stops and starts to look through a magazine and notices a squirrel on a nearby
tree chirping at her.]
Phoebe: (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're
mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be
coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.
(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!
EndMonica: Oh, Larry.
Phoebe: Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? 
Larry: No, bribes.
(Phoebe laughs.)
Phoebe: It's okay to laugh right?
Larry: Yeah, I was just kidding.
Phoebe: Okay. (She laughs harder.)
Larry: I'll check the kitchen floors.
Monica: Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
(He goes into the kitchen.)
Phoebe: Yum-my!
Monica: Larry?
Phoebe: Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Larry: (entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your
chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Monica: Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know
that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Larry: And where is your hat?
Monica: It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it. 
(She heads for the kitchen door and just after she goes through the door…)
Larry: Ahh that's the 2 points.
Phoebe: Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw
the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Larry: Oh, I don't know about that.
Phoebe: Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Larry: Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner
sometime.
Phoebe: Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places
to eat.
Larry: I-I'll call ya.
Phoebe: Okay.
(Larry goes to leave but heads the wrong way and makes a quick sidestep to go out the
right door.)
Phoebe: He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is serving Monica and Rachel.]
Monica: Thanks.
Rachel: Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
Monica: Hmm?
Rachel: How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Monica: He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're
not gonna try…
Rachel: Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff
again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I
don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Monica: Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
(Danny enters.)
Danny: (To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Monica: (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Rachel: I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Danny: (To them) Hey!
Rachel: Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?
Danny: Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's
sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Monica: Ohh, fun!
Rachel: Ohh, great!
Danny: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Rachel: Yeah.
Danny: Okay, see ya. (Heads out.)
Monica: Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Rachel: (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out,
because he wants me to ask him out.
Monica: And you're not gonna do that.
Rachel: That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's
all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint
around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Monica: So-so there is no party.
Rachel: No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up
for grabs. You follow me?
Monica: I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes
you.
Rachel: Exactly.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, they're entering to find boxes strewn about the
apartment.]
Joey: Ross?
Ross: (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
Chandler: Love what you've done with the place.
Ross: Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really
appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Joey: Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while,
why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Chandler: Oh yeah!
Ross: Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check
this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's
voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!
Joey: Hey, all right!
Ross: Pretty cool, huh?
(They both laugh as Ross heads back to the bathroom.)
Joey: (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?
Chandler: Oh, the tears are real.
[Scene: A restaurant, Phoebe and Larry are having dinner.]
Larry: You look beautiful this evening.
Phoebe: (smiles) Show me the badge again.
(He looks around and flashes her his badge and she laughs.)
Phoebe: Shiny. 
Larry: Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who
knows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been.
Phoebe: (laughing) You are just nonstop!
(He goes to the bathroom and Phoebe puts some pepper and salt on her food. With the
salt she takes a bit and throws it over her left shoulder as she faces us.)
Larry: (coming back) We're outta here!
Phoebe: Why?!
Larry: Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this
place down!
Phoebe: (awed) You have the power to do that?
Larry: This does. (Shows her his badge.)
Phoebe: (excited) Shut it down.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is entering. As he closes the door, Joey pokes
his head up from a box enclosure built using the 2 chairs.]
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: What are you doing?
Joey: Nothing.
Chandler: You built a fort didn't ya?
Joey: (smiles) Kinda.
Chandler: (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier!
All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
Joey: Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Chandler: I hate this thing!
Joey: Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't
you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is opening the door.]
Rachel: Oh, hi Danny.
Danny: Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Monica: Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Rachel: Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Monica: You are?
Rachel: Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Danny: Yeah, what's the gala for?
Rachel: It's a uh, regatta gala.
Danny: Really! You-you sail?
Rachel: No-no, but I support it.
Danny: Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.
Monica: Okay.
Danny: Take care. (Leaves.)
Rachel: Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?
Monica: What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Rachel: Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would
know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I
said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Monica: Great. So the ball is in his court?
Rachel: Ball? There is no ball.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Ross is working on his computer and Joey is
making a lot of noise.]
Ross: (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
Joey: Sorry.
(Joey starts playing with a toy alligator and has it attack him.)
Joey: Ahhhhhhhhhh… 
(Notices Ross looking at him and stops. Ross gives him his 'quiet down' maneuver. Okay,
this may take a while to explain, so center this on you screen and place your hands about
a foot apart with your fingers together and pointing straight up. Now take you fingers and
point them at the other hand and making a 90-degree angle with each of your hands and the
first knuckle counting up from the wrist. Now take your right hand, no your other right
(that was for the dyslexics), and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are
pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in
front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your
shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to
turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but
I don't want to try and describe it as well.)
Chandler: (entering) Hello children!
Joey: Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Chandler: Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
Joey: No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the
boxes. Come on!
(They go into his bedroom.)
Joey: All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
(Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps
his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)
Chandler: Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Joey: No, the quiet down thing!
Chandler: You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
Joey: Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you
know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that
had been porn?
Chandler: (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is
Ross! I survived college with him!
Joey: All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Chandler: Okay.
(They start playing.)
Chandler: No-no-no-no!
Joey: YES!!
Ross: (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs
up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
Chandler: Okay, so he's out of here.
Joey: Um-hmm.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Joey: You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken
and it was closed!
Phoebe: Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it
down!
Joey: Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where
are we gonna eat?!
Monica: I don't know, clean places?
Joey: Umm, yum!
(There's a knock on the door and Monica answers it.)
Monica: (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
Rachel: Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Monica: (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it
starts later?
Rachel: What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Monica: The fake kind! 
(She opens the door and Rachel hides behind it.)
Danny: Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Monica: We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
Danny: Thanks, see you at the party.
Monica: Okay, great! 
(He leaves and she closes the door.)
Phoebe: Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you
ladle." (Laughs.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are there. Chandler and Joey are looking
through the paper.]
Chandler: Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?
International? Apartment listings?
Ross: I'll take sports.
Joey: Mine! (He grabs it.)
Ross: All right. Uhh, international.
Joey: Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
Ross: Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though
there's never anything in here.
Chandler: Not even on page 7?
Ross: (looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable
place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Chandler: What about that circled one?
Ross: Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Joey: But it's available now! Isn't it?
Chandler: Yes, it is.
Joey: Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)
Ross: Okay, let's go.
Joey: Okay!
Chandler: There we go!
Ross: Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in
on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Chandler: Let's go quicker.
Joey: Yeah!
[Scene: The apartment in the listing, the guys are checking it out. There's one problem
though, it's roughly the size of this computer screen. As they enter Joey lets out a
whistle.]
Ross: Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)
Chandler: Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!
Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Joey: Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
(They don't move, just look all around them.)
Ross: I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Joey: But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Chandler: Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Joey: Yeah.
(He looks at them.)
Ross: (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Joey: Oh, it's perfect!
Ross: (To Chandler) How about you?
Chandler: It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Ross: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and
fill out an application.
(He exits.)
Chandler: We are bad people.
Joey: He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we
could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there waiting for Larry.]
Larry: (entering) Hey, ready for dinner?
Phoebe: Ooh, absolutely!
Larry: Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker
Street right?
Phoebe: Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.
Larry: How about Mama Lisettie's?
Phoebe: Enh. Sure!
Larry: (notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has been
setting out.
Phoebe: Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I
bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has
to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!
(Just as they're about to leave, Gunther comes out of the back carrying two garbage
bags. Larry sees this and stops him.)
Larry: Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of
the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Gunther: But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Larry: Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Phoebe: Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the
health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,
okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Larry: Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Phoebe: Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!
(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I
know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are lamenting about how they kicked Ross
out.]
Joey: Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Chandler: Yes that was a nice place!
Joey: Yeah!
Chandler: Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the
window in a bag!
Joey: Yeah!
(Pause.)
Chandler: What are we gonna do?
Joey: I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Chandler: About Ross!
Joey: Oh! Oh!
(The phone rings and Joey answers it.)
Joey: Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross
put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll
ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Chandler: (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,
barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap
dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp!
(Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello? 
(The apartment manager hung up on him and he hangs up the phone and throws in on the
chair. Joey motions, "What the hell was that?" Chandler makes a face to say,
"Think about it." Joey tries to divide 136 by 13; he's confused. Suddenly, light
dawns on yonder dunder head. He gets it.)
Chandler: Ohhhhh!
(Joey motions, "Now, that's thinking!")
[Scene: Downstairs at Danny's party, Monica and Rachel are coming down the stairs and
Rachel has on a coat to make it look as if she's just getting back. But just as they reach
the landing they see Danny out in the hall talking to a guest, Rachel then quickly pulls
Monica back up the stairs.]
Rachel: Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Monica: Just go over and say hi.
Rachel: No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from
the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
(Monica obeys.)
Monica: Hey, Danny!
Danny: Hey! What's going on?
Monica: (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.
Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this
Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly
retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,
what's this? (Points to his plate.)
Danny: Salad.
Monica: Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and
what-what's this? (Points again.)
Danny: Bread. Aren't you a chef?
(Rachel returns.)
Monica: (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
Danny: Hey! Rachel!
Rachel: Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Danny: Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Rachel: Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Danny: Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)
Rachel: Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Monica: I thought there wasn't a ball?
Rachel: Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere,
balls flying all over the place!
Danny: (returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom) This
is the girl I told you about.
Rachel: Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Danny: You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. (Leaves.)
Tom: So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Rachel: (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Tom: I'm sorry?
Rachel: No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going
on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Tom: I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Rachel: Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice
try."
(He walks off.)
Rachel: Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right
out of the park!
Monica: I think I need a drink.
Rachel: Yeah!
(They go get a drink.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross still has boxes all over the place. Joey is wearing a
football helmet, and Chandler is spinning him around in one of the chairs and counting.]
Chandler: 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Joey: (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and
falls flat on his face.)
(He tries to get up again and starts falling backwards and Chandler catches him.)
Chandler: Here we go! Here we go!
(Ross enters.)
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my
application.
Joey: You're kidding!
Chandler: You're kidding, no!
Ross: Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her
place for a while. So…
Joey: But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! 
Ross: Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Joey: Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points
to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his
door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Chandler: Yeah!
Ross: Are you guys sure about this?
Joey: Definitely!
Chandler: Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Ross: All right.
Joey: All right!
Chandler: All right, buddy!
Ross: So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain
in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?
And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the
'quiet down' maneuver).
(Chandler and Joey smile, but when Ross turns away look at each other with looks of
horror.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Chandler is entering and when he closes the
door Joey pops his head out of the fort like before, but this time he's wearing a cowboy
hat.]
Chandler: Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the
cowboy hat is a little much?
Ross: (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
Chandler: All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a
bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
Joey: Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
(Chandler does so.)
EndPresent Day
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Ross: In this life, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Joey: Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past
life memories.
Phoebe: Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Rachel: I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Monica: Oh, let's not tell this story.
All: Oh, come on!
Phoebe: Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck
on his head!
Rachel: What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Joey: Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Chandler: It's exactly like it sounds.
Thanksgiving 1992
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Phoebe is entering.]
Joey: (muffled) Hello?
Phoebe: (surprised) Hello?
Joey: Phoebe?
Phoebe: Joey? What's going on?
Joey: Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Joey: I know! It's stuck!!!
Phoebe: (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey: I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey: Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Phoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead
animal.
(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down
onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck
on Joey's head.)
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees
someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
Joey: It's Joey.
Monica: What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Phoebe: No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Monica: Well, get it off now!
Joey: I can't! It-it's stuck!
Monica: Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my
parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Phoebe: All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
(They all start thinking. Joey starts rubbing his chin, of course his chin is currently
inside the turkey so he ends up rubbing the turkey. And I didn't do that joke one bit of
justice. It's one of those you have to see it to get it jokes.)
Monica: Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs
as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!
Joey: Sorry! Sorry.
(They get into position to pull the turkey off.)
Monica: Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
(They both pull but Joey slips out and starts to fall backwards just as Chandler
enters, scaring him.)
Chandler: Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the
doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
Joey: (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Chandler: I'm over here big guy.
Joey: (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!
(Starts dancing.) I scared you!
Present Day
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]
Chandler: (laughing) You did look like an idiot.
Joey: Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember
when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut
buash?"
Ross: Yeah that's the same.
Monica: That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Phoebe: Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even
know that happened. So which one was it?
All: Which one?
Monica: Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Chandler: Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what
Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Monica: Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Thanksgiving 1987
[Scene: The Geller household, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are getting ready for Thanksgiving
dinner. The doorbell rings.]
Mrs. Geller: Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Monica: I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With
The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She
goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!
Big Nosed Rachel: Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Fat Monica: Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Big Nosed Rachel: Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was
going to come over…
Fat Monica: Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Big Nosed Rachel: Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really
creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's
thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets
Monica's parents.) Hi!
Mr. Geller: Hi Rachel!
Big Nosed Rachel: Happy Thanksgiving!
Mrs. Geller: You too sweethart!
Ross: (entering) Hey! 
(He brought home Chandler for Thanksgiving. Chandler is sporting the very popular Flock
of Seagulls haircut. Yeah, it's another you have to see it to believe it kinda thing.)
Mr. Geller: Oh my!
Ross: Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Fat Monica: Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)
Ross: Oh, this is Monica.
Fat Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Chandler: (seeing her) Okay.
Mrs. Geller: I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I
hope you're hungry.
Ross: Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving
food.
Mrs. Geller: Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Fat Monica: Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese
for dinner.
Chandler: Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
(As she is drinking, Monica laughs and Chandler's joke and Diet Coke comes out
of her nose.)
Fat Monica: dammit! (Runs off.)
(Ross points out Rachel to Chandler and goes over to talk to her. Rachel is checking
out her nose in her compact mirror.)
Ross: So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since
I've been away at college.
Big Nosed Rachel: Oh! No, not really.
Ross: Well, that's cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
(Rachel wanders into the kitchen where Monica is making Chandler's dinner.)
Big Nosed Rachel: Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut
Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Fat Monica: I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy
Branson.
Big Nosed Rachel: Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are
just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Ross: Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were
looking for.
Fat Monica: Call them mom and dad you loser!
Ross: (in a high pitched voice) Monica!
[Time lapse, dinner has finished and Chandler is sitting on the couch eating some pie.
Monica sits down beside him, and he gets pushed up a little by the wave she makes in the
couch.]
Fat Monica: Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Chandler: Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Fat Monica: Okay!
(He gets up and walks away as Rachel come running over all excited.)
Big Nosed Rachel: Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut
was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Fat Monica: Oh that's so great!
Big Nosed Rachel: I know!
Fat Monica: Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll
tell me everything.
Big Nosed Rachel: Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we
already kinda did it once y'know.
Fat Monica: I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know
whether or not you did it!
Big Nosed Rachel: I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised
that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
[Cut to the kitchen, Ross and Chandler are doing the dishes.]
Ross: So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play
her that song we wrote last week.
Chandler: Emotional Knapsack?
Ross: Yeah.
Chandler: Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're
gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Ross: Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her
all night.
Chandler: Dude, don't do that too me!
(Monica enters behind them.)
Ross: All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
(Monica suddenly gets very happy.)
Chandler: No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with
your fat sister.
Ross: Hey!
(Upon hearing this, Monica starts to break down and storms out. Only to be stopped by
her parents.)
Mrs. Geller: (holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I
don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Fat Monica: No. No, thank you!
Mr. Geller: Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, back to the present day.]
Chandler: I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Monica: Well, I do.
Chandler: I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the
stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Ross: I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Chandler: I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Rachel: Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Monica: Yes, it was!
Rachel: No, it wasn't. It was actually the…
Monica: (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for
Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Phoebe: Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Chandler: We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Phoebe: Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know
whatever.
Thanksgiving 1988
[Scene: The Geller household kitchen, Mrs. Geller is cooking and Rachel, post nose job,
is helping her.]
Mrs. Geller: So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Rachel: Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology
building.
Mr. Geller: (entering) Hi Rachel.
Rachel: Oh hi!
Mr. Geller: Wow, love your new nose!
Mrs. Geller: Jack.
Mr. Geller: What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
(He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)
Mrs. Geller: I'll get it.
Rachel: No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)
(She opens the door to reveal Chandler and Ross. Unfortunately, they seem to have their
holidays mixed up. They think it's Halloween and they're going as Crockett and Tubbs from
that legendary TV show of the late 80's, Miami Vice. God, we looked silly back
then!)
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving! 
Mr. Geller: (To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!
Chandler: Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we
used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
Ross: So uh, where's Monica?
Mrs. Geller: She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel,
and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
(Monica enters, but she forgot something. Oh, about 150 pounds. In other words, she
lost weight, big time!)
Monica: Hi, Chandler.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Monica: What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She
turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
Chandler: You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Ross: Dude!
Chandler: Sorry!
Mrs. Geller: Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to
hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Ross: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart.
And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays
for both teams!
Monica: So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
(She heads for the kitchen and Chandler watches her leave and admires the view.)
Mr. Geller: Dude!
Chandler: Sorry.
(In the kitchen.)
Rachel: (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back
for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Monica: Well it didn't!
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart
is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him
back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then
I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Rachel: Okay, that we may be able to do.
Monica: How?
Rachel: Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Monica: What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight
so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Rachel: Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever
take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just
gonna make him think that you are.
Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah.
Monica: And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the
door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Rachel: Then, you will definitely get him back!
Monica: Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Rachel: Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns
you on.
Monica: What do you mean?
Rachel: Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!
(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against
my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it
down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Monica: (excited) I can do that!
Rachel: Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)
Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)
Chandler: Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac
and cheese like last year.
Monica: Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to
follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and
cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them
between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and
hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,
and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a
knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)
and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any
exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the
box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
Chandler: Are you all right?
Monica: Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box and
in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips
through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)
[Scene: The hospital, Chandler has been rushed to the emergency room.]
The Doctor: What do we got here?
The Paramedic: Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
(They go through the doors into the trauma room, opening them by ramming the gurney
through them, only Chandler's foot is hanging off the end and he screams in pain.)
Ross: Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!
Severed toe, you just said it!
The Doctor: It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Mr. Geller: Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
The Doctor: Did you bring the toe?
Monica: Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her
purse and hands it to the doctor.)
The Doctor: (opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and—(Stops
suddenly.)
Monica: What?! What is it?
The Doctor: You brought a carrot.
Chandler: What?
The Doctor: This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Rachel: You brought a carrot?!
Mrs. Geller: Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Monica: God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
The Doctor: It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Chandler: Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Monica: Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Mr. Geller: Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
Present Day
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is reacting to the story.]
Chandler: That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Monica: I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Chandler: That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Monica: I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Chandler: Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He
storms out.)
Monica: Chandler! (Follows him out.)
Ross: (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Joey: You're a dork.
[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is standing in front of his door.]
Chandler: I can't believe this.
Monica: Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Chandler: Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried
all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you
later.
Monica: Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Chandler: Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is sitting on one of the chairs and the
duck is running around him and quacking.]
Chandler: Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I’m happy all
the time!
(There's a knock on the door and Chandler gets up to answer it. He opens the door to
reveal Monica with a turkey over her head.)
Chandler: Nice try.
Monica: Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Chandler: Look, Monica…
Monica: Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Chandler: This is not going to work.
Monica: I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Chandler: You are so great! I love you!
(Monica stops suddenly and turns around slowly.)
Monica: What?
Chandler: Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!
Monica: You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Monica: Yes, you did!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Monica: You love me!
Chandler: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
(Joey walks in and sees Monica. He freaks out and runs back into the hallway,
screaming.)
Ending Credits
Thanksgiving 1915
[Scene: The Western front during World War I, Phoebe, in yet another past life, is once
again a nurse tending to yet another dying soldier. But this time she's doing it with a
French accent.]

French Phoebe:  Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please
get some gauze in here! (A shell explodes outside next to the tent and when the smoke
clears, Phoebe still has her arm.) Whew! (Her arm falls off and starts pumping out blood.)
This is getting ridiculous uh! 
EndRoss: I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.
(There’s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There’s
one lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)

Joey: Why are you doing this?

Ross: Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the
bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.

Joey: Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to
spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?

Ross: Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
Joey: Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little
confused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why
do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down. (Ross sits
down.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh,
yeah!! Huh?!

Ross: So what, we just sit?

Joey: Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and
hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)

Chandler: (Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.

Joey: (In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.

Chandler: (Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and
Joey laugh silently.) It’s been six months! It’s not funny!
Joey: But, I love you.
Chandler: Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
(Joey hangs up.)

Joey: And that’s Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are there. Phoebe walks
in ringing a bell.]

Phoebe: Hey you guys, guess what?

Chandler: The British are coming?

Phoebe: Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.)
Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection
donations.

All: Ohh.

Phoebe: (Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my
bucket.

Chandler: Ohh.

Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the
people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year,
I’m going to do the whole city.

Monica: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very
popular. (Chandler laughs.)

Joey: So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?

Phoebe: Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they
hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing
"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.

Rachel: Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this.
(He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested.
Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten
who he is.

Danny: Hey guys.

All: Hey Danny.

Monica: Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look
at, right?

Rachel: Thanks, Mon.

Danny: Well, of course.

Monica: Do you want to go out on a date with her?

Rachel: Monica!!!

Danny: (Looking at Monica) Absolutely! Is Friday okay?

Monica: Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.

Danny: (To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (To
Rachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)

Rachel: (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what?
Don’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.
[Scene: Estelle's (Joey's Agent) Office, Joey is there.]

Joey: How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian
actor from Queens.

Estelle: Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.

Joey: She’s a woman!
Estelle: What can I say? She nailed it.

Joey: (Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?

Estelle: Well, you’re just going to say no again but...gay porn.
[Scene: In front of Macys, Phoebe is collecting donations and ringing her bell.]


Phoebe: Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put
some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and
down as if she is spreading joy.)

Monica: (Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: I just wanted to see how it's going.

Phoebe: Well, it's going okay.

Monica: (Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out. 
Phoebe: Oh, thanks!
Monica: Yeah!
Phoebe: Wow!
(Monica puts some change in Phoebe's bucket.)
Phoebe: Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Monica: Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)
Phoebe: Just get your nails done?
Monica: Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her
change purse into the bucket.)
Phoebe: Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and
spreads her joy.)
(A man walks up and puts a dollar bill in.)
Phoebe: Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
(The man starts to take some change out.)
Phoebe: Wait, you can't take the money out.
The Man: I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Phoebe: But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
The Man: I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Phoebe: Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…
The Man: Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)
Phoebe: Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She
scowls at him.)
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is telling Ross how he didn't get the part.]
Joey: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Ross: I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something
happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what
about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Joey: Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the
chances I could get those guys to star in it?
(Ross just stares at him until he figures it out.)
Joey: Wait a second, I could star in it!
Ross: Or that.
Joey: I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline
that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Ross: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to
it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Joey: Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Ross: Yeah!
Joey: Thanks!
Ross: (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The
only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Joey: Done!
Ross: And it can't be Joey.
Joey: It's not.
Ross: Or Joseph.
Joey: (disappointed) Oh.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning. Monica enters from her room wearing
nothing but a robe.]
Monica: Hey, what's up?
Rachel: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm
around her.
Monica: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Rachel: Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our
relationship!!
Monica: You had no relationship!!
Rachel: No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the
plan!
Monica: Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with
Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway
girl.
Rachel: She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the
date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
(Rachel goes into her room and closes the door. Which allows Monica to let Chandler out
of her room.)
Monica: Come on, hurry!
(Chandler runs out the door and closes it behind him. After a short pause the door
opens and Chandler comes rushing back through, grabs Monica, kisses her good-bye, and
heads back out.)
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is trying to write his movie, Chandler is
playing a game on the counter by trying to flip a ping pong ball with a spoon into a
nearby bowl.]
Joey: Hey, how do you spell suspicious? 
Chandler: Why?
Joey: Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
(Chandler makes it into the bowl.)
Chandler: Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Joey: You're driving me crazy with that!
Chandler: Okay, I'll stop.
Joey: Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
(Chandler slides the bowl to the far end of the counter. He tries again, but he hits
the spoon to hard and the ball goes flying away.)
Joey: Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Chandler: You wanna play?
Joey: Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have
to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Chandler: Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets
home.
Joey: (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a
notch?
Chandler: I'm intrigued. 
Joey: All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. 
Chandler: Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit
back.
Joey: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Chandler: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Joey: Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the
door.)
[Scene: In front of Macys, Phoebe is still ringing her bell. A guy puts some
change into the bucket.]
Phoebe: Thank you, Happy Holidays.
(Another woman walks up and throws something into the bucket.)
Phoebe: Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her and
walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
(Another guy walks by and throws his light cigarette butt in the bucket.)
Phoebe: Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet
another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.
(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is
that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is reading what Joey wrote.]
Ross: All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops
reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,
you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!
(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The
official rulebook of Fireball.
Joey: Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Chandler: (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven
mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter
fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
Ross: This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not
the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Joey: You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Ross: (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to
work. (To Joey) Now come on! 
Joey: Hey!
(He tries to fire a burnt tennis ball into the bowl Chandler is standing by, but Ross
grabs the ball away from him.)
Ross: No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!
(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the
burn spots on his oven mitts.)
[Scene: Outside Danny's apartment, Danny and Rachel are returning from their date.]
Danny: I had a really nice time tonight.
Rachel: So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
(He kisses her.)
Danny: I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's
asleep on the couch.
Rachel: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,
"Yes.") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on
the couch!

Danny's Sister: (opening the door) Oh, I thought I heard you.
Danny: Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this
is Rachel.
Rachel: Hi!
Krista: Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix
myself up!
Danny: Like it would help.
Krista: You are so bad! (Hits him softly.)
Danny: You are! (Hits her back.)
Krista: You are! (Hits him softly.)
Danny: You are! (Hits her back.)
Krista: You are! (Hits him softly.)
Danny: You are! (Hits her back.)
Krista: You are! (Hits him harder this time.)
Danny: You are so dead! I'm gonna get you. 
(He starts chasing her around Rachel a couple of times before she runs into the living
room and he tackles her on the couch where he starts tickling her.)
Rachel: (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue
to ignore her.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is complaining to Ross and Monica about the
bucket.]
Phoebe: Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put
in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Monica: No.
Phoebe: Does it look like an ashtray?
Monica: No.
Phoebe: Does it look like a urinal?
Monica: Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)
Ross: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Phoebe: Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice
Bucket!
Monica: Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Phoebe: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know
what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you
guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)
Rachel: (entering from her room) Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?

Monica and Ross: Sure.
Rachel: Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys
wrestle?
Ross: Oh-oh, yeah.
Monica: All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Ross: Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Monica: Still, I was quick as a cat.
Rachel: Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl
on the subway.
Monica: Oh, you're kidding.
Rachel: Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Monica: (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Ross: Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Monica: Too strong for me?
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna
go?
Ross: Oh fine.
Monica: Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start
wrestling.)
Rachel: Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
(She leaves them to wrestle.)
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is cleaning the foosball table, Joey is
working on his script.]
Chandler: (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in
20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Ross: Joey's not going.
Joey: (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.
Chandler: Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Ross: Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Joey: Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Chandler: (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he
relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Ross: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Joey: Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never
played.
Chandler: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.
Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Ross: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Joey: Come on look guys, don't fight.
Ross: And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if
you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Chandler: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Ross: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Joey: Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of
Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Ross: How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,
no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Chandler: I paid for those tickets!
Ross: No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Chandler: Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are listening to a story being
told by Danny and his sister.]
Danny: …so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (His
sister) forgets the camera!
Joey: Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Chandler: When did that happen to you?!
Joey: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really
pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!
Chandler: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Krista: Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She
takes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it
again. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it
and some filling falls into his lap.)
Danny: Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Krista: Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The
thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his
crotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)
Krista: We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Danny: Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Rachel: Oh, great!
Chandler: Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
Monica: That was unbelievable! 
Rachel: Okay, see? I told you!
Joey: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Chandler: I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Joey: They're brother and sister!!!
[Scene: In front of Macys, Phoebe has adorned her bucket with numerous signs.
Like "We are not a urinal!" and "I have no Macys info."
And other stuff like that. She also has a scowl on her face as she is ringing her bell. A
little old lady walks up to make a donation but Phoebe stops her.]
Phoebe: Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.
(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the
lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
(Another man walks up with a drink in his hand, Phoebe stops him too.)
Phoebe: Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and
then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his
face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker
walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought
I told you to get outta here!
Bob: Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a
less high-profile spot.
Phoebe: What?!
Bob: Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Phoebe: That chick can't handle my corner.
Bob: Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Phoebe: Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)
(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for
that bitch. (The old lady.)
[Scene: Danny's apartment, there's a knock on the door and he answers it.]
Danny: Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Rachel: Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Danny: What?! Why?!
Rachel: Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,
and…
Danny: Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a
problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Rachel: Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on
here but let's…
Danny: Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Rachel: No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Danny: Are you close with them?
Rachel: No-no, they're not very nice people.
Danny: Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So
what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Rachel: Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it
does sort of…
Krista: (calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
Danny: (seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?
Rachel: Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is there as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down
there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Ross: Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach
them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Joey: (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already
finished my five pages for today!
Ross: Yay!
Chandler: Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
Joey: No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Ross: I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to
focus. Huh?
Chandler: Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL
THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Joey: Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.
And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So
would you guys read it for me?
Chandler: All right. (Takes a copy.)
Ross: All right. (Takes another copy.)
Joey: Okay. (Reading.) "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys
are hanging out." Ross (Points to him.)
(Ross and Chandler start to read Joey's script aloud.)
Ross: Hey man.
Chandler: What is up?
Ross: About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Chandler: No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Ross: Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest…
(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Chandler: Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
Ross: I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right
Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.
Chandler: (To Ross) I'm sorry too.
Joey: Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Ross: (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.
Chandler: I am sorry, Ross.
Joey: A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's
it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to
both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well
you co-created Fireball. The end.
Chandler: This took you all day?!
Joey: No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up
with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are about to read another one of Joey's
efforts.]
Joey: (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out.
(Monica and Rachel begin to read from the script.)
Monica: Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Rachel: I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Monica: It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really
appreciate it?
(They both start to read ahead.)
Rachel: Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
Monica: This is disgusting!
(They both throw the scripts in his face.)
Rachel: I'm not reading this!
Joey: What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
EndJoey: All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Chandler: (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
Joey: What's the matter?!
Chandler: We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so
y'know…
Joey: All right, I'll take care of it.
Monica: Oh no, wait! Joey!
(They try to stop him, not sure of what he's planning. He ignores them and goes to talk
to Ross.)
Ross: (hopping) 73! 72! 71!
Joey: Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or
Phoebe?
Ross: What?
Joey: Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Ross: Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Joey: Chandler.
Ross: Awww, man! Really?
Joey: Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Ross: That's a good point.
Joey: Yeah.
Ross: Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Joey: Okay, great!
Ross: All right.
Joey: Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Phoebe: It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Joey: Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Rachel: What?!
Ross: Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the
history.
Rachel: So?
Joey: So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Rachel: Oh, good point.
Joey: Yeah!
All: (watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
(And with that everyone starts playing tonsil hockey. Chandler with Monica, Ross with
Phoebe, and Joey with Rachel.)
Chandler: (To Monica) Happy New Year!
Monica: Happy New Year.
Ross: (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Phoebe: You too!
Rachel: (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!
Joey: So did that do anything for ya?
(Rachel slowly walks away.)
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, after the party. Everyone has left, except for the gang.]
Ross: Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Rachel: But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Ross: Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I
am gonna make myself happy.
Chandler: Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Ross: Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That
my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Phoebe: Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Chandler: That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a
planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Phoebe: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the
ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Monica: She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than
you do of not making fun of us.
Ross: In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without
making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Chandler: I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50
bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And it
starts right now!
Joey: All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Ross: Ohh.
Phoebe: Really?! How come?
Joey: Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love
it would be great if one of those was true.
Phoebe: Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Joey: Really? Who-who have you taught?
Phoebe: Well, I taught me and I love me.
Joey: Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Rachel: Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing
these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk
drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Monica: Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Rachel: I don't gossip!
(They all laugh.)
Rachel: Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass
that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I
mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Monica: Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Rachel: What? They were like this! 
(She puts her hands over her breasts and indicates that the coworkers boob job resulted
in one pointing up and one pointing down with her hands by pointing up with one hand and
down with the other.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to a beautiful woman as Chandler and Joey enter.]

Woman: I'll see you tomorrow.
Ross: Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!

Chandler and Joey: Hey!
Ross: I just asked that girl out.
Chandler: Nice!
Joey: Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Ross: Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name
and phone number on it.)
Chandler: (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Ross: That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Chandler: Horn-swoggle.
Joey: You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Chandler: No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits
down rubbing his temple.)
Joey: Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep
quiet as Phoebe enters.)
Ross: Hi, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey! 
Ross: Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's
ear.) Hornswoggle.
Phoebe: Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.
Ross: All right, see you later.
Joey: See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. 
Phoebe: Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the
guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the
guitar.)
Joey: Umm, okay.
Phoebe: Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the
chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She
starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your
imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see
them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand
and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm,
Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)
Chandler: What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might
find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with Rachel.]
Phoebe: Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Rachel: I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's
just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep
it. (Goes into her room.)
Joey: Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's
chords.)
Phoebe: Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)
Joey: Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I
stopped by this guitar store and…
Phoebe: Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?
Did you?!
Joey: No.
Phoebe: Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings.
Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to
learn to play guitar?
Joey: Yes!
Phoebe: Then don't touch one!!
Ross: (entering, with Ben) Hi!
Ben: Hi! 
Monica: Hi Ben!
Ben: Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)
Chandler: (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else
see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the
pants!
Rachel: I think they're very nice.
Monica: I like 'em.
Joey: Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
Monica: I like them a lot.
Chandler: That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally
wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe
there's something in that area.
(They all speak at once in general approval of his pants selection; Joey asks where he
got them. I can't pick out the rest of it.)
Ross: Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store
that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I never
really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
(No one says anything.)
Chandler: Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
Ross: (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Joey: You look like a freak.
Rachel: Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and
Monica.)
(Monica starts taking pictures of Ross and Ben, with the flash.)
Ross: What are you, what are you doing?
Monica: It's my New Year's resolution!
Ross: What, to blind my child?
Monica: No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think
it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Joey: Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica
starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the
excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
[Scene: Elizabeth Hornswoggle's apartment; Ross is there on his date with her. They are
sitting on the couch watching a movie. Ross is obviously hot.]
Ross: (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still
wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot? 
Elizabeth Hornswoggle: No.
Ross: Okay, it must just be me then.
(He shifts on the couch and a ripping sound emanates from his lower regions, the sound
reminds one of a brief explosion of gas. In other words, it sounds like he farted. She has
a look of horrific wonderment, wondering "Did he just fart?")
Ross: That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I
use your bathroom?
Elizabeth: No, go ahead.
Ross: Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another
word he heads into her bathroom.)
[Cut to Elizabeth Hornswoggle's bathroom, Ross frantically pulls his shirt out and
drops his pants. He exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his
legs. He sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. He next grabs a
magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he
wants it to. So he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one.
He jumps up and hops to the sink. He turns on the water and starts to splash some on his
legs, cooling them further.]
Ross: (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….
Elizabeth: (yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Ross: 'Kay!
(He goes to pull up his pants, but can't seem to get them past his knees. He
frantically tries to pull them up to no avail. Panic sets in.)
Ross: Oh my God!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is drilling Joey on the chords as Monica looks on.]
Phoebe: Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he
does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all
last night?
Joey: Yes! Yes, I did.
Phoebe: Then do Iceberg!
Joey: (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.
Phoebe: G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?
(Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God! 
Joey: What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Phoebe: No, but you're questioning my method!
Joey: No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica
standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
Monica: Thank you. (Leaves.)
Phoebe: Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Joey: Your other student, was you!
Phoebe: Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Joey: (looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of
him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)
Phoebe: Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying
to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Rachel: (entering, singing) "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Phoebe: Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)
(Rachel looks shocked, gets over it, notices she's alone, and picks up the phone. The
last part of which is something she shouldn't have done, because the phone is already in
use. By Monica, and now Rachel can hear every word.)
Monica: (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross
picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Chandler: (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Monica: (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…
Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, The phone rings and Joey answers it.]
Joey: (answering phone) Hello?
Ross: (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Joey: Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Ross: Well, you can help me!
Joey: Okay.
Ross: Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…
Joey: Nice!
Ross: No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they
must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I
can't put them back on. I can't!
Joey: Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Ross: Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.) 
Joey: Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of
the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Ross: Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a
large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It
doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)
They're not coming on man.
Joey: Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline? 
Ross: Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Joey: Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Ross: Hold on.
(Ross proceeds to apply copious amounts of the lotion on his legs. He literally starts
spraying the back of his legs with the lotion, and as he applies some to his butt he makes
a happy face like he enjoyed that sensation. After using about half the bottle he again
tries to pull up his pants, but at the first sign of resistance, his hand slips off of the
pants and hits him in the forehead.)
Joey: Ross? You okay?
Ross: They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the
powder have made a paste!
Joey: Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Ross: What difference does that make?!
Joey: Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself
a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Rachel: (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?
Ross: Dude, what am I gonna…
Joey: (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works
out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)
Rachel: Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Joey: Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over
the place.
Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Joey: What-what is it, what is it?
Rachel: Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot
tell anyone.
Joey: Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Rachel: Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Joey: I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the
secrets but can't tell anyone!
Rachel: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Joey: And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! 
Rachel: I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the
phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his
fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing
that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his
current state.)
Joey: I'm not listening to you!
(Chandler seeing that Joey has his eyes closed sneaks over and picks up the chicken.
The chicken starts flapping it's wings in protest as Chandler holds the chicken inches
from Joey's face. Joey stops yelling and upon opening his eyes sees the chicken, screams,
and falls to the ground in horror.)
[Scene: Elizabeth's apartment; Elizabeth is inquiring as to the delay in Ross's exit
from her bathroom.]
Elizabeth: Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get
kinda freaked out.
Ross: All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Elizabeth: No, let's just leave the lights on.
(Ross opens the door and steps into the living room. He has fully removed his pants and
holds them wrapped into a ball in front of his crotch. His legs are covered in the powder
and lotion paste. He looks terrible.)
Elizabeth: Oh my God!
Ross: I had a problem.
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is there to apologize to Phoebe.]
Joey: Hey, Pheebs?
Phoebe: No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Joey: Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method
was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch
a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You
really think I'm ready?
Phoebe: Uh-huh!
Joey: Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.
However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table
and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
Joey: (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right…
Phoebe: No!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his horrible trek back home without
pants on. The whole gang is there.]
Chandler: Oh my God!
Monica: We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Ross: This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm
a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
All: No. No, you're not a loser.
Ross: Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
Monica: Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's
picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Ross: Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Monica: See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now
that's something.
(All at once.)
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: That really is something; that's really cool.
Joey: Howdy partner!
Ross: Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with
fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss
Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a
cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
Monica: Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go
do my laundry.
Chandler: Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
(They both exit.)
Phoebe: Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang
around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Rachel: Good luck, honey!
Phoebe: Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
Rachel: Hey, uh, Joey?
Joey: Umm?
Rachel: Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Joey: Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling
his fingers out of his ears.)
Rachel: I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be
okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Joey: Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah.
Yeah!
Rachel: (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to
Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Joey: Now? You want me to go over there now?
Rachel: Yeah!
Joey: Do you know something?
Rachel: Do you know something?
Joey: I might know something.
Rachel: I might know something too.
Joey: What's the thing you know?
Rachel: Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Joey: I can't tell you what I know.
Rachel: Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Joey: Okay, fine.
(Silence ensues.)
Joey: You don't know!
Rachel: All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into
Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually
the thing that I think that I know! (Note: Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that
line. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't that
easy.)
Joey: (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!
Rachel: AND YOU KNOW!!!
Joey: Yeah, I know!!!!
Rachel: Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you
known?
Joey: Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this
for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird
about that! Listen… (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)

Joey and Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So…
(Pause.)
Joey: Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Rachel: Ohhh, yeah, me too.
(They both exit.)
Phoebe: That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.

Chandler: (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it
anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs?
Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home
planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And
Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and
sighs in relief.)
End(Chandler's boss (Doug) walks up.)
Doug: Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady
and what the hell is she doing with you?
Chandler: I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is
Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Monica: Hi, nice to meet you!
Doug: Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Kara: Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)
Doug: Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
Chandler: No, sir.
Doug: Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
(Chandler does a fake laugh.)
Doug: Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler
and Monica alone.)
Monica: What was that?
Chandler: What?
Monica: That noise you just made?
Chandler: Oh, that was my work laugh.
Monica: Really? Your work laugh?
Chandler: Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one
too.
Monica: All right, check me out.
Chandler: Okay.
(She walks up to where Doug is finishing another joke to another group.)
Doug: …says $30 Father; same as in town.
(Monica does a fake laugh. For the laughs, you'll have to see the episode. I can't
describe them.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is buying a muffin as Chandler runs in.]
Chandler: Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! 
Monica: Really?
Chandler: And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you
repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis
with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when
we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway,
I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Monica: Hey, I thought you already had one.
Chandler: Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park
and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey
Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Rachel: Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Chandler: Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)
Rachel: (To Monica) Hey!
Monica: Hi!
Rachel: What's up?!
Monica: What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Rachel: Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my
friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with
you?
Monica: Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Rachel: Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about
anything!
Monica: Okay. Umm…
Rachel: Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Monica: Okay, what's going on with you?
Rachel: Nothing! You go!
Monica: Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but
I don't anymore.
Rachel: Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do
have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?
Monica: Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Rachel: No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe is settling a dispute between the chick and
the duck.]
(The duck quacks.)
Phoebe: Okay, then what happened?
(The duck flaps its wings frantically.)
Phoebe: (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!
Ross: (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Phoebe: Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This
is not over!
Ross: No! No! No!
Phoebe: What?!
Ross: I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and
now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!
Joey: (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Ross: Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Joey: Really?
Ross: Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Joey: Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and
stuff.
Ross: That's okay, Joe.
Joey: All right, let's go Pheebs.
Ross: (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!
[Scene: A tennis court somewhere in the city of New York, it's the doubles match-up of
a century Chandler and Monica versus Doug and Kara.]
Doug: Bing! 
(Hits the ball towards Chandler who returns it back to him. He then hits the ball at
Monica who slams it and it bounces off Kara's leg.)
Kara: Oww!!
Monica: Game!
Doug: Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.)
Are you all right sweethart?
Kara: (out of breath and mouths) I'm not all right.
Doug: We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
(They both walk off the court.)
Monica: Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be
carved!
Chandler: Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Monica: I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Chandler: Let them win one.
Monica: Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's
popping pills.
Chandler: You're not even giving them a chance!
Monica: They have racquets don't they?!
Doug: Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Chandler: Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?
(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
Monica: I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
(She serves to Doug who returns it to Chandler. As it bounces over his head Chandler
swings and misses.)
Chandler: Oopsey, missed it!
Monica: I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and
Kara and scores a point.)
Doug: Nice shot.
(Chandler glares at her and she shrugs her shoulders. Monica serves again; and Kara
returns it.)
Monica: I got it!!
(Chandler cuts in front of her and hits the ball high and long.)
Chandler: Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Chandler are returning from the game.]
Monica: I can't believe you let them win!
Chandler: Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed
racquet from his bag.)
Monica: I was frustrated.
Chandler: It was my racquet.
Monica: I was frustrated with you!
Chandler: If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow
night.
Monica: Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around
them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you
around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I
gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Chandler: Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, the next morning the girls are there with Joey.]
Monica: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Joey: Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Rachel: Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Joey: That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
(Ross enters.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: There he is!
Monica: Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)
Where the hell have you been?!!
Ross: Just, y'know out.
Rachel: Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Phoebe: What were you doing?
Ross: I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Rachel: You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Joey: (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Ross: Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do
whatever I want!
Joey: He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
[Suddenly the door opens and Ross's mystery girl enters. I'll give you a hint to who it
is: OH….MY….GAWD!! Uh-huh, it's Janice.]
Janice: (entering) Ross you left you scarf in…(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does
the laugh.)
(They all turn and with shocked looks on their faces stare at Ross. Ross is at a loss
for words at this moment.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, continued from earlier.]
Janice: Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen!
I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Rachel: Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Janice: So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Phoebe: Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)
Janice: Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does
her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)
(They all turn and glare at Ross.)
Ross: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…
Phoebe: You two will have very hairy children.
Ross: Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Rachel: Ross! Janice?!
Joey: All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He
obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Ross: Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!
We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Phoebe: So are you actually gonna see her again?
Joey: Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Ross: I am gonna see her again.
Joey: Damnit Phoebe!!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is going through her purse as Rachel rushes in.]
Rachel: (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during
our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even
when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Monica: My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Rachel: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Monica: What?!
Rachel: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just
tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said,
"Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Monica: Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me
know how that one turns out.
Rachel: Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Monica: Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.
Big…(Thinks)…ot.
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Rachel: All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and
Chandler.
Monica: Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe and Joey are there.]
Joey: All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Joey: All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes
the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And
they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
Phoebe: Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Joey: Judge rules, no violation.
Phoebe: Ohhh.
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Yeah!
(Neither of them turns around from watching the chick and the duck look for the tasty
treat.)
Ross: Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with
Janice! 
(They both turn around.)
Joey: What?!
Phoebe: Are you serious?!
Ross: Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to
me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It
is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Phoebe: You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…
Joey: And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Phoebe: (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an
old Wonton!
Joey: Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Phoebe: Ohh, tough call.
Joey: Yeah.
[Scene: Doug's house, Chandler, Monica, and them are just finishing dinner.]
Doug: But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her
husband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)
Kara: So how do you kids like your coffee?
Monica: Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Chandler: Just a little bit of sugar.
Doug: Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta
sweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)
(Doug and Kara go get the coffee.)
Monica: (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Chandler: Oh, you get used to it.
Monica: Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be
it for me on the work things.
Chandler: So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Monica: I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out
with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Chandler: Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
Doug: (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it
if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not
laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?
Chandler: What?
Doug: The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Chandler: Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Doug: Excuse me?
Chandler: Well, I just…
Monica: (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see
Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was
weak physically. You get it now honey?
Chandler: I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.
Monica: I thought you could use the help.
Chandler: Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is going through the mail as Joey enters.]
Joey: (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Rachel: Sure! Why?
Joey: Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Rachel: What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps
lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right
now!
[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross's apartment, Rachel enters and sneaks up to Chandler's
bedroom where she overhears Chandler and Monica talking.]
Chandler: (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist
jokes now?!
Monica: Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate
having to lie to Rachel!
Chandler: But we're not ready to tell yet!
Monica: I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I
told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
(Rachel decides not to confront them and starts to walk out, knocking over a lamp in
the process.)
Monica: (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Rachel: Hey! Hi!
Monica: Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the
fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
Rachel: Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,
look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Monica: Okay great! 
Rachel: Yeah!
Monica: Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was
cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Rachel: Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Monica: Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Rachel: That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my
books!
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: I'll get back to my new job.
(Pause.)
Rachel: 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and
is almost in tears.)
(After she exits, Chandler enters.)
Chandler: Man, she is really gullible.
(Monica motions that it went right over Rachel's head.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Janice are sitting on the couch.]
Gunther: Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)
Ross: Thanks!
Janice: Actually, I should get going.
Ross: Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on
sabbatical from work, right?
Janice: Yes! Yes! You did!
Ross: Oh…
Janice: What is wrong now?!
Ross: This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my
marriage falls apart and then…
Janice: I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job!
And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee—ahh!! Ross, we need to
talk.
Ross: Okay. Sometimes I feel…
Janice: No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our
day in the sun.
Ross: Huh?
Janice: (starting to cry) You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't
think I can take another second of you whining!!
Ross: Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm
too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that
I annoy you, Janice.
Janice: Well yeah!!
Ross: OH…MY…GOD!!
Janice: Are you gonna be okay?
Ross: I am now.
Janice: Okay.
(Joey enters.)
Joey: Umm, hi.
Janice: Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)
(Joey looks at Ross with a horrified look on his face.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is reading a magazine as Ross hands him a
beer.]
Ross: Dude, we got to talk.
Chandler: Okay.
Ross: I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I
hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real
laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?
Chandler: Why would I be mad?
Ross: Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't
uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or
girls they're related to.
Chandler: (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you
know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They
forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,
but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Ross: Okay.
Chandler: I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Ross: All right.
Chandler: And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven
dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it
down—let's write it down!
End(The gang moves off as Phoebe greets the new guest.)
Phoebe: Yeah, welcome.

Man: Hello. Hello.
Phoebe: Umm here's your 3-D glasses.

Man: Oh, umm, all right.
Phoebe: So how did you know Francis?

Man: Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I
was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
Phoebe: Really?! What's your name?

Man: Umm, Frank Buffay. 
(Needless to say, Phoebe is stunned into silence. And one audience member gasps.) 
Frank Sr.: (Seeing the look on her face) Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh,
actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Phoebe: You're Frank Buffay?
Frank Sr.: Shh! (Whispers) No! Joe Hill!
Phoebe: You just said…
Frank Sr.: Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
(Hands back his glasses and hurries out.)
Phoebe: But…
(Phoebe takes one step after him and stops.)
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: What?! What honey?
Ross: What happened?
Phoebe: That was my dad!
Chandler: Oh my God!
(They all look down the hall he left from.)
Joey: (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it
out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me.
(Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap
him in his face.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: The Funeral Home, continued from earlier. Phoebe is returning after looking for
her father.]
Monica: Oh, did you catch him?!
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Ross: Wh-what did he say?!
Phoebe: He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." (They stare at her,
dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Rachel: Why?! Why not?!
Phoebe: Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's
gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Joey: What did you say to him?
Phoebe: Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of
Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house
later.

The Pastor: Could everyone please take their seats?
Phoebe: All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna
say good-bye to my Grandma.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: All right, let's go say good-bye.
(They put on their glasses and try to find their way to their seats.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, after the funeral, everyone is there.]
Joey: (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Rachel: Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that
part.
Chandler: And a date with a man!
Joey: Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And
it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't
make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact
that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)
Phoebe: All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Rachel: Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Phoebe: Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Ross: Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you!
I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and
me outside right now!" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.
Monica: Well, at least you scared someone.
Phoebe: Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think
I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Monica: Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. 
Phoebe: All right.
(She goes over and tries to give Phoebe a massage. Phoebe yelps in pain and jumps away
from her.)
Phoebe: Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Monica: What are you talking about?
Phoebe: As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Monica: (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to
Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She
starts giving Chandler a massage.)
Phoebe: (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates
it! He's in pain!
Monica: No he's not!
Chandler: (wincing) Yes, he is!
Monica: What?!
Chandler: I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Monica: You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Ross: Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Monica: But the minute we start to lie to each other… (Pauses after she
realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.
[Scene: Joey's audition, he is with bag.]
The Casting Director: Any time you're ready, Joey.
Joey: (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a
table and I'll buy you a drink.
The Casting Director: (stopping him) I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it
without the purse?
Joey: Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new
here. Maybe we should—I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a
question.)
The Casting Director: Sure. What?
Joey: Well, first it's not a purse.
The Casting Director: Okay, anytime.
Joey: I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's
bag!
The Casting Director: Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
Joey: All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the
latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
The Casting Director: Umm, do you sell these bags?
Joey: Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
The Casting Director: Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Joey: Yeah but I didn’t read anything.
The Casting Director: I think we've seen enough!
Joey: Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the
bag.) We got it! We got it!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is poking his head in.]
Chandler: Hey, is Rachel here?
Monica: No.
Chandler: (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this
afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Monica: Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I
just wish you could tell me—just say, "I don't like your massages."
Chandler: (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
Monica: (starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.
Chandler: Okay, but now see you're crying!
Monica: I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at
work.
Chandler: What?
Monica: (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Chandler: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Monica: Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Chandler: Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Monica: I'm crying here!!
Chandler: Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If
anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves,
"Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Monica: Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad
massage, well who would get that?
Chandler: Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Monica: So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Chandler: Absolutely!
Monica: Okay. I suck!
Chandler: Yeah! (They hug.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Frank Sr. is just arriving.]
Phoebe: Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Frank Sr.: Thank you. All right.
Phoebe: Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on
the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to
state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Frank Sr.: Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Phoebe: Okay.
Frank Sr.: So, what did Francis leave me?
Phoebe: Huh?
Frank Sr.: Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Phoebe: Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her
purse) this lipstick.
Frank Sr.: Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's (opens it) oh it's—ew used. Umm,
cool.
Phoebe: Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my
official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You
and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Frank Sr.: Yes, yes I was.
Phoebe: Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,
or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Frank Sr.: It really says that?!
Phoebe: Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)
Frank Sr.: Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Phoebe: Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A.
Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad,
bad man?
Frank Sr.: Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up to
leave.) But umm… Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give
Lilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)
Phoebe: What?!
Frank Sr.: Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note?
Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me
the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note,
would you give it to her please?
Phoebe: But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Frank Sr.: Yeah, yeah. Why?
Phoebe: Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)
Frank Sr.: She what?!
Phoebe: She's dead.
Frank Sr.: Are you sure?
Phoebe: Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
Frank Sr.: I can't believe this. I just—I can't believe this.
How-how—Oh my God. How long ago?
Phoebe: 17 years ago.
Frank Sr.: Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Phoebe: Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe,
(pause) is on this couch.
(Silence ensues.)
Phoebe: Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Frank Sr.: Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, (Sits down next to her and brushes against her
leg.) Oops. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say. I
just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Phoebe: Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Frank Sr.: So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very
sorry that I left?
Phoebe: Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a
difference anyway, so you can just go.
Frank Sr.: All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
Phoebe: That's a defense?
Frank Sr.: Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on
backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
Phoebe: You make up songs?
Frank Sr.: Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did
it, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.) 

Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.
Why won't you go to sleep?
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.
You're, you're, you're keeping me uppp! (Yeah, that's to the tune of Smelly Cat.)

Yeah. 
(Phoebe is trying not to smile. He moves closer and very shyly holds out his hand and
turns his head, hoping for Phoebe to take his hand. She doesn't.)
Frank Sr.: I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm… (Backs
away.)
Phoebe: Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)
(She holds his hand for a little while then…)
Phoebe: Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey returns from his audition and finds everyone but
Phoebe there.]
Joey: (dejected) Hi.
All: Hey!
Chandler: Hey man, how did the audition go?
Joey: Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)
Rachel: What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Joey: Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems
with me.
Ross: What kind of problem?
Joey: Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the
bag!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Ross: Nooooo!
Joey: Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Monica: Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Joey: I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?
(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Rachel: Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are
with it… (Looks for help.)
Chandler: Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
Rachel: …I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Joey: I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Rachel: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t
have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)
controversial.
Chandler: Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
EndRachel: OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe: OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!

Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!

Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe: YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop
screaming!!
Ross: (entering) What's going on?

Phoebe and Rachel: Ohhh!!!
Rachel: (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi! 
Ross: What?! What?!
Rachel: Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!
Ross: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Phoebe: (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)
(Ross starts jumping and screaming incoherently and hops over and joins in on the group
hug.) 
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there talking about Chandler and Monica.]
Phoebe: You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or
going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda
from camp!
Rachel: Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Phoebe: Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She
might be able to do better.
Joey: (entering) Hey guys!
Rachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!
Joey: What? What?
Rachel: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Joey: You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
Rachel: No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we
saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against
the window.
Phoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel
knows?
Joey: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!
Phoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own.
Rachel: Wh-what do you mean?
Phoebe: Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry
we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Rachel: Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Joey: No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling
them.
Rachel: Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Joey: I can't take any…
Phoebe: No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Joey: Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets.
I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Rachel: You don't have any secrets!
Joey: Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey
shies away.)
Rachel: (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Joey: Ugh.
Phoebe: Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My
sexuality.
Chandler: (entering) Hello children!
All: Hey!
Phoebe: Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
(She gets up and goes over to Chandler who's ordering some coffee from Gunther.)
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Chandler: Really?
Phoebe: (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep!
Have you been working out?
Chandler: Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles
uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
Phoebe: Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.
Chandler: Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Phoebe: Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one
person I want to the most.
Chandler: What's going on?
Phoebe: I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and
how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's
right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just
something to think about. I know I will.
(She makes a show of bending over to get her coat and showing off her bum. She then
walks out, leaving no one to eat her cookie.)
[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Chandler and Monica are there, of course. Like who else
would it be, duh!]
Monica: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Chandler: Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a
tiny little bunny.
Monica: Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Chandler: Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Monica: What?
Chandler: The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think
Phoebe was hitting on me.
Monica: What are you talking about?
Chandler: I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Monica: That's not possible!
Chandler: Ow!
Monica: I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were
charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Chandler: Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Monica: I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Chandler: No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my
bicep for crying out loud!
Monica: This bicep?
Chandler: Well it's not flexed right now!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, and Chandler are there. Monica is
entering from her room.]
Rachel: Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Monica: Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Rachel: Oh.
Monica: Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Chandler: Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a
huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out
a lot! Thanks!
Monica: I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Phoebe: I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Ross: Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it
himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Rachel: Oh.
Ross: No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a
little bribe to 
tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window.
(They all head to the window.)
Monica: Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Ross: No.
Chandler: That new mountain bike?
Ross: No.
Monica: Well what did you send?
Ross: A basket of mini-muffins.
Phoebe: But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you
send?
Ross: The small one.
Rachel: What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the
apartment?
Ross: Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy
over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Chandler: Your work makes me sad.
Ross: Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work!
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)
Rachel: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica: Bye!
All: Bye!
Phoebe: Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)
Chandler: (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!
Monica: Actually, I did!
Chandler: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Chandler: Are you serious?
Monica: Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only
explanation for it!
Chandler: (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my
bulging biceps—She knows!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is snoozing with Hugsy, his bedtime penguin
pal and Chandler and Monica come storming in.]
Chandler: (entering) Joey!
(Joey quickly tries to hide Hugsy by throwing it over his head.)
Joey: Yeah?
Chandler: Phoebe knows about us!
Joey: Well I didn't tell them!
Monica: Them?! Who's them?
Joey: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Monica: Joey!
Joey: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Chandler: Oh man!
Joey: I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that
you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Monica: Unless…
Joey: No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Monica: Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see
they don't know that we know that they know! So…
Chandler: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is looking at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment through
binoculars.]
Ross: Noooo.
Rachel: Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Phoebe: Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Ross: Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none
of them even compares to that one!
Rachel: Y'know what you should do?
Ross: Huh?
Rachel: You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with
him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or
my underwear.
Joey: I'm listening.
Rachel: (To Ross) See?
Ross: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been
watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now
he had the trampoline.
Phoebe: He broke that.
Ross: Well, he had gravity boots.
Rachel: Yeah, he broke those too.
Joey: So he likes to break stuff.
Ross: Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He
opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Phoebe: I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Joey: Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Ross: Right. (Exits.)
(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)
Rachel: Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To
Phoebe) It's Chandler.
Phoebe: (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
Chandler: Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the
phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
Phoebe: Eh?
Chandler: Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't intrigued.
Phoebe: Really?
Chandler: Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come
over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Phoebe: I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Rachel: Are you kidding?!
Phoebe: No!
Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?
Joey: No.
Rachel: Joey!
Joey: They know you know.
Rachel: Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Phoebe: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!
Joey: I couldn't even if I wanted too.
[Scene: Outside Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, Ross is knocks on the door and Ugly Naked
Guy answers it. He's ugly. He's naked. And he's holding a huge jumbo soda.]
Ross: Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who
applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm
sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica and Rachel and Phoebe are planning
their respective strategies to break the other pairing. Joey is not amused.
Monica: (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
Chandler: Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
Monica: Oh yeah!
[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.]
Phoebe: All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All
right, I'm gonna go in.
Rachel: All right. Be sexy.
Phoebe: (laughs) Please.
(She saunters over to Chandler with a mean pair of 'Come hither' eyes and she glares at
Monica.)
Phoebe: So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Chandler: (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?
Phoebe: Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Chandler: Yes.
Phoebe: Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual
intercourse.
(As she walks away, Chandler mouths a scream to Monica. How motions and mouths,
"It's okay, it's okay.")
Joey: (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked
Guy has a naked friend!
(They all run over to the window.)
Rachel: Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica
covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's
shoulder.)
All: Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Phoebe ready for her date.]
Rachel: Show time!
Phoebe: Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Rachel: Okay! (She runs to get some.)
Phoebe: And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does
so.)
(In the meantime, Rachel has returned with the perfume and sprays a mist out in front
of Phoebe who walks through the mist and does a little spin.)
[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Monica is getting Chandler ready for his half of
the plan.]
Monica: All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex
with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Chandler: Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Monica: Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Chandler: How do you know?!
Monica: Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Chandler: At this?!
Monica: Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
[Cut to the hallway, Phoebe is outside getting some last minute instructions from
Rachel.]
Rachel: (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from
right here!
Phoebe: Okay.
Rachel: Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)
Phoebe: Good idea! 
Rachel: Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.) 
Phoebe: Oh now, don't give away the farm!
(Phoebe knocks on the door with the wine and Chandler answers it. Rachel hides next to
the door.)
Chandler: Phoebe.
Phoebe: Chandler.
Chandler: Come on in.
Phoebe: I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought
some wine. Would you like some?
Chandler: Sure.
(She makes a big show out of pulling out the cork and pours the wine.)
Phoebe: So, here we are. Nervous?
Chandler: Me? No. You?
Phoebe: No, I want this to happen.
Chandler: So do I.
(They click their glasses and take a sip. That sip turns into a gulp, which quickly
progresses into their mutual draining of their glasses at once.)
Chandler: I'm gonna put on some music.
Phoebe: Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive
and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)
Chandler: You look good.
Phoebe: Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip
that sweater vest right off!
Chandler: Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Phoebe: Really?
Chandler: Oh, do you not want to?
Phoebe: No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have
you rub lotion on me.
Chandler: (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
[Cut to the bathroom, Chandler is entering.]
Chandler: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her! 
Monica: She's bluffing!
Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)
[Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]
Phoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey: (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my
chair!
Rachel: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Joey: Ooh!
Rachel: Okay!
Joey: I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
Phoebe: Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.
Joey: It's not my first time.
[Cut to the bathroom.]
Monica: You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler: Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Monica: Of course.
[Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from
behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.)
Chandler: Oh, you're-you're going?
Phoebe: Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
Chandler: (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were
gonna be having all the sex.
Phoebe: You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
Chandler: Not if I kiss you first.
(They move closer to together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He
puts his hand on her left hip but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe
then grabs his butt. Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her
shoulder.)
Phoebe: Ooh.
Chandler: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Phoebe: Here it comes. Our first kiss.
(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her
eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a
short while and pushes Phoebe away.)
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Phoebe: And why not?!
Chandler: Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe: You're-you're what?!
(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)
Chandler: Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Monica: I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
Phoebe: I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!
Joey: Dude!
Chandler: And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say
your breasts are still showing.
Phoebe: God! (She turns and buttons up.)
Joey: All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Monica: Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Chandler: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
(Joey suddenly gets very angry.)

new outlook on life.]
Ross: A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work
over once it's y'know, furnished.
Dr. Ledbetter: I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Ross: Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Dr. Ledbetter: I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Ross: Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to
work. I—What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh… What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
EndRoss: Hi!

Guy: Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants
committee.
Ross: Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Steve: Oh hi Phoebe.
Phoebe: Mr. President.
Steve: I came to talk to you about Howard.
Ross: Howard?
Steve: Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone
who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of
thing.
Ross: Oh that's nice.
Steve: Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or…
Ross: Oh. Uhh…
Steve: Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it
under my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)
Ross: No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.
Steve: Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Ross: Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Steve: Oh, okay, I get it. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met
Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Steve: Howard's the handy man!
Ross: Yes but too me he's just, man.
Steve: Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)
Ross: (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Phoebe: Yeah. I really like his glasses.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross is lamenting to Chandler and Rachel about his
troubles in his new building.]
Ross: …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and
now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit
them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy
who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Chandler: (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
Rachel: Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you
just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Ross: It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Rachel: Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Ross: Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta
run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
Rachel: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Chandler: Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I
don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Rachel: Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably
already in Monica's head.
Chandler: Wh-wh-why?!
Rachel: Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Chandler: Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Rachel: Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already
know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's
a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Chandler: I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one
that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then
the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?!
I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
Rachel: No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that
makes everything different.
Chandler: Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Rachel: Not unless different means the same.
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is sitting on the couch with Katie.]
Katie: You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her
thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)
Joey: (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Katie: No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and
he retreats to the arm of the couch.)
Joey: Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like
you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully
punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real
bat.
Katie: Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun
of me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the
couch.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Monica are curled up on one of the chairs.]
Monica: Isn't this great?
Chandler: Hmm.
Monica: Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)
Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Chandler: Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
Monica: Are you okay?
Chandler: Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Monica: What-what are you doing?
Chandler: I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that
I'm seeing casually.
Monica: Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
Chandler: What?!
Monica: Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around
about marriage and stuff.
Chandler: Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Monica: Oh and you know what I want!
Chandler: Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Monica: I do not have baby fever!
Chandler: Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and
everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn
down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Monica: Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about
you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Chandler: Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the
head--in your head!
Monica: You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel
tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And
did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)
Chandler: Well, I did not know that.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is getting advice from Ross and Joey.]
Chandler: It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,
this is fixable.

Ross and Joey: Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Chandler: By me?
Ross: Oh, no!
Joey: No-no.
Ross: Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Joey: Yeah, big!
(Monica enters.)
Joey: Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Monica: Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?
Chandler: Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
Monica: I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Chandler: Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Monica: What?!
Chandler: Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how
to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Monica: Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna
have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be
in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)
(Chandler turns to watch her go and then sees Ross and Joey both with huge grimaces on
their faces.)
[Scene: Ross's apartment, he's having his party, only he's the only guest. He gets up
and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it. So he takes it off and
puts on one that says Dr. Geller and he puts the Ross one underneath the Dr. Geller one.
Then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for Howard raging in the apartment
across the hall.]

Party Guests: (chanting) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (Ross goes to investigate
the noise) Howard! Howard! Howard! (They're holding Howard above their heads.) Howard!
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (He sees Phoebe chanting along with them.) Howard! Howard!
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Ross: Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
Phoebe: Oh, hi Ross!
Ross: What are you doing?
Phoebe: Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for
Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)
Guest #1: See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Ross: You chipped in?!
Phoebe: Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Ross: Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was
totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Phoebe: Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the
exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Ross: Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Phoebe: No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you
talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Steve: (walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey!
Steve: Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch
apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walks
away.)
(Ross turns and glares at Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Yeah, okay, my bad.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is getting some coffee as Joey enters. He's looking a
little puffy, but that's probably from the large number of different color sweaters he's
wearing.]
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.
Joey: Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing
six sweaters?
Rachel: Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Joey: Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra
padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's
gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Katie: (entering) Hi!
Joey: Hey! Hiya!
Rachel: Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Katie: Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! (She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)
Rachel: Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")
Katie: Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, (Punches Joey) are too
much! (Punches Rachel.)
Rachel: Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are
the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
Katie: Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! (She punches Rachel.)
Rachel: Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
Katie: You're so sweet! (Punches Rachel yet again.)
Rachel: Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
Katie: Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Joey: Huh.
Katie: Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Joey: Uhh….
Katie: You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now!
Well? Are you gonna?
Joey: Nah.
(She looks at Rachel and storms out. After she's left Joey hugs Rachel in thanks.)
[Scene: Howard's party, Phoebe is talking Ross up to two more partygoers. Ross isn't
happy about it.]
Ross: (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
Phoebe: (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.
(Laughs.)
Ross: (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
Phoebe: Ooh. (Turns to him.)
Ross: Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Phoebe: No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all
right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
(They go to the food table.)
Ross: So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Phoebe: Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some
sympathy.
Ross: Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
Phoebe: But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Ross: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because
I don't totally understand what happened there.
Ross: (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!
Phoebe: Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Guest #2: (sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries
dumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?
(Steve goes over to look at Ross who's trying to look cool, but has some frosting on
his lip.)
Steve: 3-B!
All: Oh yeah, aww!
Steve: Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think
it's time you went home?!
Guest #3: Yeah, leave!
All: Yeah, get out! Now!
Steve: Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Phoebe: All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that
I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and
Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he
didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes
Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you
guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I
saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is
don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now,
but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind
numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something
woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!
So, I think you all know what I mean.
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross and Phoebe have been banished to Ross's place.]
Phoebe: Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just
thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you
could look like the hero.
Ross: Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler comes running in. Everyone else is already
there.]
Chandler: Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is
she here?
Monica: (raising her hand) I'm Monica.
Chandler: I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,
us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and
awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
Monica: Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Chandler: (getting out a ring box) Monica…
Monica: No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Chandler: Will you marry me?
(Phoebe hides her eyes in shame. Rachel is starring at them wide-eyed and open-mouthed.
Joey and Ross are stunned to temporary silence.)
Ross: Oh-no. No. No.
Joey: What a bad idea!
Rachel: Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)
Monica: Chandler, why are you doing this?
Chandler: I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Monica: Chandler.
Chandler: I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Monica: Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because
you're sorry?
Chandler: No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much
fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.)
Will you be my wife?
Monica: (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I
want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Chandler: Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Monica: Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never
said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Chandler: Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these
guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
Monica: Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: She's right y'know.
Ross: Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Monica: Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this
relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Chandler: I didn't think I was!
(They hug.)
Monica: Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Chandler: Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the
rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole
in that door. (Points at the door.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Everyone is there.]
Joey: Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Ross: No, I will not!
Joey: Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Ross: You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
(They all laugh.)
Phoebe: Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to
you last week.
Rachel: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to
move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Chandler: Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Monica: Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you
were so, a long time.
Ross: This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break
thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is
laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
Chandler: That's not funny.
Joey: That's not funny at all!
(They all get up and leave.)
End[Scene: Joey's bedroom, time lapse. He's asleep and dreaming. In his dream he's doing
the crossword puzzle with…wait for it…Monica!]

Dream Monica: Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!

Dream Joey: Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.

Dream Monica: Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog
but…

Dream Joey: Cat.

Dream Monica: Yes! You are so smart! (Kisses him.) I love you.

Dream Joey: I love you too.
(They hug.)
[Cut back to Joey in bed, he's smiling, enjoying the dream as he wakes up. Suddenly, he
realized what he was dreaming about and bolts upright in bed.]
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there but Ross and Joey. Gunther hands them the bill,
and Chandler gives some money to pay it.]
Rachel: (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.
Phoebe: All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!
(Donates it.) How much more do we need?
Rachel: A couple of bucks.
Phoebe: Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this
could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh
my God, this is a police badge!
Monica: Wow!
Chandler: Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't
serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I
think I can come up with something better than that.
Rachel: Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Phoebe: Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm
at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy
has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in
hope.)
Joey: (entering) Hey, you guys!
Chandler: Hey!
Rachel: Hey Joey!
Monica: Hey.
Joey: (To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Monica: Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Joey: Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's
sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.
Monica: I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Joey: No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Monica: Are you saying I smell bad?
Joey: No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the
bathroom.)
Monica: What's with him?
Chandler: Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was
shot by a hunter.
[Scene: A couch store, Ross is trying to decide on a new couch for his place. He has
dragged Rachel along for the trip, and she's not too happy about it. Ross is sitting on it
in different ways to see how it feels. He tries to just sit on it normally, and then he
tries flopping on it. One thing about this couch, it's huge. It's like twice the size of a
normal full size couch. Whoever designed this thing, needs help and fast.]
Rachel: (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!
Ross: (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering
nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch
that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Come
here to me!"
Rachel: What?! You say that to kids?!!
Ross: No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Rachel: Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
The Salesman: You picked a great couch.
Ross: Yeah?
The Salesman: Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? (Hands him a
clipboard.)
Ross: Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as
the couch!
Rachel: Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Ross: Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and
hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the
couch.)
Rachel: Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting
her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?
Ross: Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!
Come on! Come on!
Rachel: (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her
amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Ross: Yeah!
The Salesman: You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Ross: Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the
store.)
The Salesman: Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Ross
stops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against a
wall.)
Rachel: Ross!
Ross: What's that supposed to mean?
Rachel: Ross!
The Salesman: Well you, her, I mean, she's very…y'know. And you're
like…y'know.
Ross: Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
The Salesman: Really? You two?
Ross: Yeah! Rach?
Rachel: Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a
very heavy couch.
Ross: Then tell him quickly.
Rachel: (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.
Ross: Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Rachel: Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Ross: A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!
(Rachel pushes on the couch and pushes Ross out the door.)
[Scene: Outside of Central Perk, Phoebe is exiting and sees a woman put out her
cigarette on a tree.]
Phoebe: Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? 
The Smoking Woman: Yes?
Phoebe: You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
The Smoking Woman: Yeah I can, it worked real well.
Phoebe: No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
The Smoking Woman: I won't! (Turns away) Until I have my next cigarette.
Phoebe: Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
The Smoking Woman: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book
'em.
The Smoking Woman: Who are you talking too?
Phoebe: Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you
apologize to the tree.
The Smoking Woman: I am not going to apologize to a tree!
Phoebe: You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The
woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!
The Smoking Woman: I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Phoebe: Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
[Scene: Ross's building's lobby, he and Rachel are about to attempt to take the couch
upstairs.]
Ross: Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)
Rachel: Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Ross: Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
(They start the attempt. Ross is going backwards and reaches the first landing. This
staircase has three steps then a landing, makes a 90-degree turn, and has more steps
before another landing and another 90-degree turn.)
Ross: Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the
railing.)
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Ross: Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!
You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.
You got it?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Good-good-good. 
Rachel: Oh-oh! 
(She can't stay at the end as the couch rounds the turn so she shifts to the back
corner of the couch and is at a 90-degree angle to it.)
Ross: Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? 
(She don't got it as the couch slips out of their grips and falls over the bottom
railing.)
Rachel: Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling Chandler and Monica how she fought crime
in her own way with the badge she found.]
Phoebe: …so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.
(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!
Monica: (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
Phoebe: I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Chandler: Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could
get arrested.
Phoebe: You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at
her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for
the door just as Joey enters.)
Phoebe: (To Joey) Hey.
Joey: (To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.
Chandler: Hi, Joe.
Joey: Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.
Monica: Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)
Joey: (backing away) What?! Why?!
Monica: What is going on with you?
Joey: Nothing!
Chandler: Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Joey: All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't
want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)
Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said
that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I
don’t want to talk about it.
Joey: Well, it involved Monica.
Chandler: You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!
(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.
(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I
love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
Joey: Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt
about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. 
Monica: What was the dream about?
Joey: Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword
puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica
and I'll be moving out.
Monica: Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with
me!
Joey: It-it doesn’t?
Monica: No!
Chandler: No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous
because I've become the apartment stud.
Joey: That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Monica: Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we
y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Joey: In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Monica: Um-hmm.
Chandler: Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are
you attracted to her?
Joey: (looks at her) Not really.
Chandler: Well there you have it!
Monica: Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly
realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you
just want a girlfriend!
Joey: No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I
mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but
y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Chandler: Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started
dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Joey: Friends first? That's interesting.
Monica: You become friends after?
Joey: No, never done that either.
Rachel: (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Chandler: Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
(Monica and Chandler both remember a special moment between them.)
Monica: (laughing) That's right.
(They realize the implication of their behavior, stop instantly and head for his
bedroom. In the meanwhile, Joey is starring at Rachel in a seductive way.)
Rachel: (noticing him) What's up Joey?
Joey: (in a sexy voice) How you doin'?
(Rachel is stunned.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is walking up and notices a car that is parked
half on the curb and right in front of the door, making it difficult for people to enter
Central Perk.]
Phoebe: Excuse me, is this your car?
Guy: Yeah.
Phoebe: Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're
blocking the entrance. 
Guy: Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Phoebe: Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause
I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)
Guy: (he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.) So am I!
Phoebe: Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park
anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.
10-4. (Tries to leave.)
Cop: (stopping her) Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
Phoebe: I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Cop: Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
Phoebe: I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Cop: Who-who else is in vice up there?
Phoebe: Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Cop: Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Phoebe: Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Cop: No, I don't know him.
Phoebe: (starts to walk away, but stops) Don’t try to call him or anything,
'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Cop: Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Phoebe: I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)
Cop: (following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I
heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. (Phoebe's stunned) And where did
you find my badge?
Phoebe: Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs
away.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering. Rachel is there getting some tools to
help Ross out.]
Rachel: Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Joey: Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can
blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.
(He starts staring at her longingly.)
Rachel: Thanks!
Joey: Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking
to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Rachel: I know.
Joey: Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm
thinking of getting me one of those.
Rachel: What's up Joe?
Joey: Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…
Rachel: Yeah?
Joey: …is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,
"Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…
Rachel: (laughing) What are you saying?
Joey: I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Rachel: Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me
first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Joey: I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)
Rachel: (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm… No
honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you
date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend,
build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Joey: Won't-won't that take longer?
Rachel: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Joey: Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe
first!
[Scene: The lobby of Ross's building, he's sitting on the couch at the bottom of the
stairs, and he's practicing enticing women to join him on the couch.]
Ross: Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Ross: Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Rachel: Well, I brought the next best thing.
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Chandler: Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…
Ross: Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay
Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.) 
Rachel: Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)
Ross: Oh, that's me.
Rachel: Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Ross: No! That's-that's my arm!
Chandler: (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really
liked your new couch.
Ross: Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. 
(Chandler and Ross head for opposite ends of the couch.)
Rachel: Okay!
Chandler: Okay.
Ross: Come on, Chandler. 
(They pick up the couch and after throwing off the last pillow; Rachel helps out on
Chandler's end.)
Ross: All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!
(Chandler has moved forward and is now underneath the couch as it heads up the first
set of stairs.)
Ross: All right, ready?
Chandler: Yeah.
Ross: Turn.
Chandler: (straining) Okay.
Ross: Turn! Turn!
(As they turn the couch, Chandler gets sandwiched between the railing and the couch.)
Chandler: Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Rachel: Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Ross: Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They
start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!
Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Chandler: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
(They set the couch down.)
Ross: Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.

Chandler and Rachel: You think?!
Ross: All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
(As they start back down the couch drops a little bit and gets jammed. They try to free
it to no avail.)
Chandler: Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Ross: I can't believe that didn't work!
Rachel: I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Chandler: Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is returning and finds Chandler, Monica, and Rachel
are there.]
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Joey: Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)
Chandler: (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Joey: Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed.
Monica: Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Joey: (To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Rachel: What?! Why?!
Joey: Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As
soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I
suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her
roommate!
Monica: What about the closeness?
Joey: Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering with a pizza and finds everyone but Ross
there.]
Joey: (entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Chandler: Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
(They all walk over to get a slice.)
Joey: (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?

(They all throw their pieces back as there is a knock on the door.)
Monica: Who is it?

Voice: N.Y.P.D!!

Phoebe and Joey: Oh my God!
Joey: Uhh, just a minute officer!! 
(He throws his piece back in the box, runs into the living room, looks for a place to
hide the pizza, finds one, slides the box under the couch, sits down on the table, and
tries to quickly chew the food in his mouth.)

Cop: I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Phoebe: Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Rachel: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Phoebe: Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.
(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck
Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But
you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Cop: Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand
right?
Phoebe: Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once
he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Cop: I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you
today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Phoebe: I would love it if I weren't here!
Cop: Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you
would like to go to dinner with me?
Phoebe: Me?!
Cop: Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking
about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.

Chandler and Joey: Nice!
Phoebe: Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Cop: Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Phoebe: Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…
Cop: Gary.
Phoebe: Gary.
Gary: Okay, so it's a date.
Phoebe: Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find
me?
Gary: Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through
the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Phoebe: Ohh, impressive.
Gary: Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and
you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Phoebe: Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Gary: Okay. (He starts to leave.) So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you
up?
Phoebe: All right, I can't wait!
Gary: Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
(Chandler busts out laughing and everyone just looks at him.)
Chandler: (To Rachel) He has a gun!

that is not cut in half!

Phoebe: Umm, cups.
Chandler: Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Ross: Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Phoebe: Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and
Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Chandler: Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
Phoebe: Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the
door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!
Joey: Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Ross: What's up?
Joey: Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me
going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I
think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Ross: Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Joey: That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career
we're talking about here!
Ross: Well, you just…
Joey: I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone
should step aside it should be Ben!
Ross: What?!
Joey: What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Chandler: (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the
door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
Ross: Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you
just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Joey: At least I care about his feelings!
Ross: What?!
Joey: Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?
Ross: And why wouldn't he get it?
Joey: Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he
dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Ross: Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Joey: You just give him a spoon baby!
Ross: Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Joey: Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Ross: You're kid's name is Raymond!
Joey: Yeah?! So's yours!
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there as Rachel enters.]
Monica: (To Rachel) How did work go?
Rachel: Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,
y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Monica: You stink!
Rachel: Thanks!
Monica: No, I'm-I'm serious!
Rachel: Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.
This is actually the smell of success.
Chandler: Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Rachel: I did not!
Chandler: Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Rachel: All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Chandler: I wish I had smoked for my career…
Monica: That's so gross!
Rachel: No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a
little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler: Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Monica: Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm
not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)
Chandler: I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
[Scene: The smoker's balcony, Rachel, Kim, and Nancy are all puffing away on their
cancer sticks.]
Kim: So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Nancy: Absolutely!
Rachel: I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
Kim: Rachel didn't you just light that?
Rachel: Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,
y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.
Nancy: I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Kim: Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every
Monday morning it's like (Mimics chain smoking.)
Nancy: Tell me about it!
Rachel: Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Kim: It does sound appealing.
Nancy: Oh, I never could do it.
Rachel: Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We
can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Kim: Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Rachel: Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their
cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
Kim: My late husband gave me that lighter. (Rachel laughs.) I'm not kidding.
Rachel: Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's
lighter.)

me while I use the ladies' room?
Joey: Oh yeah, no problem.
Carol: Thanks. (Exits.)
Joey: (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya,

Joey: (angrily) Ross!
Ross: (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!

Joey: Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's
okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
The Casting Director: Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm,
soup."
Joey: Oh, what did I say?
The Casting Director: Hmm, noodle soup.
Joey: How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!
The Casting Director: All right, let's try one.

Rachel: Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Kim: Uh-oh, busted!
Rachel: Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Kim: Yeah. That didn't work out.
Nancy: Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Rachel: Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least
told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Kim: No. No! You're doing great! Don’t you give up! That's why we didn't
tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Rachel: Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Kim: Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not
gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on,
get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Rachel: Okay. (Starts to walk away.)
Kim: (to Nancy) So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Rachel: (hearing that) Oh man!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel's surprise party. The apartment is festooned with
cups. There are cups everywhere! Cup centerpiece, cup garland, etc., etc]
Phoebe: (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner!
Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)
Chandler: Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Monica: (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!
(Chandler starts to follow her into the kitchen.)
Phoebe: (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets
of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours
some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!
Chandler: Awesome!
Monica: Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're
all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Chandler: There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
Monica: Y'know…go! Go! Right there! (Points)
Chandler: Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
(Rachel enters.)

All: Surprise!!
Rachel: What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Monica: That's the surprise!
Rachel: Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean
Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
(Everyone stops and looks at Chandler, who's nodding.)
All: Surprise!
Rachel: Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Phoebe: I was in charge of cups.
Rachel: Oh, okay, not so weird.
[Cut to another part of the room, Ross is going to talk to Joey.]
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey.
Ross: Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Joey: Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
Ross: No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Joey: Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck.
I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his head
in disgust.)
Ross: Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you
suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Joey: What you do mean?
Ross: I think, sub-consciously…
Joey: Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Ross: (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that
Ben would get the part.
Joey: Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.
Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…
Ross: No!
Joey: No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was
more important to see him succeed.
Ross: There you go. Thank you!
Joey: Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Ross: No.
Joey: Eh, what are you gonna do?
Ending Credits
[Scene: The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are out smoking as Chandler sticks his head
out the door.]
Chandler: (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was
supposed to meet her for lunch.
Kim: Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Chandler: Okay, great.
(Kim exhales and Chandler stares at it longingly.)
Kim: (to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette)
whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be
enough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah,
absolutely!" (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag
from her cancer stick.)
Chandler: I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
EndChandler: Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Caitlin: Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Chandler: Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more
interesting.
Caitlin: It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Chandler: Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go. 
(The duck starts quacking.)
Caitlin: Hey, where's the chicken?
Chandler: Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came
first.
Caitlin: (laughs) Great. I'll see you later!
Chandler: Okay, bye!
(He closes the door and turns to see Ross glaring at him.)
Ross: What the hell was that?!
Chandler: What?
Ross: The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm,
let's say my sister?!
Chandler: I was not flirting.
Ross: It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,
nasally noises.)"
Chandler: Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not
flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Ross: Yeah, right.
Chandler: You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move
towards Ross.)
Ross: (backing away) I'm good.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are in the kitchen.]
Rachel: I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &
Order!
Phoebe: I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Rachel: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Phoebe: Don't get me started on that.
(Ross and Chandler enter with the pizzas.)
Chandler: I was not flirting.
Ross: And on your anniversary, for shame!
Rachel: What's going on?
Ross: Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Chandler: I was not and oh God, shh!
Ross: Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting
on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Phoebe: Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Ross: Well…
Chandler: Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
(Ross looks at Rachel.)
Rachel: Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then.
I think it's okay that we see other people.
Ross: Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Rachel: Hm-mmm.
Ross: And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. 
Phoebe: (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay
Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Ross: This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when
she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Phoebe: See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Joey: (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You
remember my grandmother!
Rachel: Big night!
Phoebe: This is so cool!
Chandler: So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Joey: Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Chandler: I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just
stares at him.) I've done it again.
Joey: She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's
believed in me. 
(They both start speaking Italian to each other, and since I'm not Italian and don't
understand one word, we'll move on to the English portion of the show. Not, that I'm
English. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that I'm not. Y'know I think
I should shut-up now and move on. Anyhoo, she says something about Joey being fat I think
based on this line.)
Joey: Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…
Monica: (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Chandler: Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)
Monica: So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in
London…
Chandler: Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
Monica: Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Chandler: The one that doesn't.
Monica: That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Chandler: Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Monica: That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
Phoebe: But I like it here!
Monica: You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?
Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Phoebe: Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get
dressed and I'll look for them.
Monica: Great!
Phoebe: Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you
borrowed.
Rachel: Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her
room.)
(Phoebe then gets possessed 'cause she starts speaking in tongues. She speaks Italian
to Joey's grandmother. She is quickly exorcised and returns to speaking in English. Of
course, too most people English is a strange language as well. But none of them are
probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. So why am I talking
about them? I have absolutely no clue. Moving on…) 
Joey: Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Phoebe: I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we
could really tell.)
Rachel: (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!
Phoebe: Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Rachel: Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Phoebe: Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I
know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Phoebe: Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Rachel: Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Phoebe: These are her earrings.
Rachel: Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow
her stuff!
Phoebe: Why not?
Rachel: Because I lose her stuff!
[Time Lapse, the gang is now watching Law & Order. By the way, the entire
rest of the episode takes place in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Why are they called
apartments when they're all stuck together? Something to think about.]
Joey: Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
(His grandmother asks him something.)
Joey: Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Chandler: If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she
understand the difference?
Monica: (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
Rachel: Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Monica: It's a diaper commercial.
Rachel: Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
(There's a knock on the door.)
Caitlin: Pizza delivery!
Ross: I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)
Caitlin: Hi!
Ross: Hi!
Caitlin: One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Ross: Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like
8-year-old boys.
Caitlin: What?!
Ross: (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you
thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Caitlin: Oh. Thanks.
Ross: You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Caitlin: Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Chandler: Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Caitlin: I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)
Chandler: You're welcome.
Ross: You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
Chandler: What?
Ross: This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Monica: What's goin' on?
Ross: Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Chandler: Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
Monica: It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Ross: Really?!
Chandler: Really?!
Monica: It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Chandler: (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with
guys all the time?
Monica: Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean
anything with you!
Chandler: Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than
I am.
Joey: (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)
Monica: Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Chandler: Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.
Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other
women?
Rachel: Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Ross: And thank you, for that.
Rachel: But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never
very good at the flirting thing.
Ross: What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Rachel: Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn
nine years later you had me!
Ross: All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to
order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt.
Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!
Phoebe: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!
Rachel: Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Phoebe: On your dresser.
Rachel: Okay that is the one we already have!
Joey: Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops
on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.
Monica: What?
Joey: (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if
she finds out.
Chandler: (smiling) Well, what is it?
Joey: (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.
Rachel: (smiling) What?!
Ross: (smiling) Are you sure?
Phoebe: (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?
Joey: (smiling) Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there
Rachel: (smiling) Yeah.
Joey: (smiling) I'm in it.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, it's continued from before the commercial break.]
Phoebe: (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?
Joey: (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When
they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Phoebe: (not smiling) That's not good.
Joey: (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all
smile.)
Rachel: (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your
fault.
Chandler: (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out
soon?
Grandma Tribbiani: (Something in Italian to Joey.)
Joey: Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of
course it isn't him.)
Grandma Tribbiani: (pointing at the screen) No! Sam Waterston!
Joey: No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Grandma Tribbiani: No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors,
Capricorn One.
Chandler: Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
(Phoebe gets up.)
Monica: (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to
leave as soon as the show is over.
Phoebe: But I already gave them back to you!
Monica: No you didn't.
Phoebe: All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.
(Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?
Rachel: It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's
last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)
Phoebe: Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Rachel: Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Phoebe: Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
(Rachel heads for Joey and Chandler's and Phoebe heads for the kitchen to find Ross.)
Ross: (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for
ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Phoebe: (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?
Ross: Do you like it?
Phoebe: No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Ross: Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Phoebe: Ohh! I did not get that.
[Cut to Chandler and Monica on the couch.]
Chandler: So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Monica: Yeah, it's good.
Chandler: See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the
Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Monica: Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which
they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Chandler: Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are
different for men and for women.
Monica: Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Chandler: Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when
you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is
thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Monica: No way!
Chandler: It's true.
Monica: Well that's pathetic!
Chandler: Again true.
Monica: And this goes for all guys?
Chandler: All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys
from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Joey: (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still
haven't told her!
Ross: Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch)
ten minutes left!
Joey: I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!
Monica: No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Joey: (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs
out before anyone can stop him.)
Grandma Tribbiani: Joey!
Chandler: Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it
for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.
[Time lapse, Rachel is coming back from Chandler and Joey's.]
Rachel: (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
Phoebe: Did you find it?
Rachel: The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've
been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)
Phoebe: Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Rachel: Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)
Monica: (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives
her the one-minute sign.)
Phoebe: (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!
Rachel: I don't know, I don't know.
Phoebe: All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Rachel: Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Phoebe: I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Rachel: Ohh that'd be great!
Phoebe: Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Monica: Yeah, what is it?
Phoebe: Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Monica: (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it
you lost it.
Phoebe: I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Monica: All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Phoebe: No. 
Monica: Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
Phoebe: Yeah! You're the best!
Rachel: Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen
honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it.
I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)
Monica: (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel
looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's
not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Rachel: Your sunglasses?!
Monica: Yes!
Phoebe: Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)
Caitlin: (from outside) Pizza!
Ross: (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Chandler: Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
Rachel: Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I
don't flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
Ross: You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?

All: Caitlin!
Grandma Tribbiani: Caitlin!
Ross: (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating
like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
Caitlin: It's uh, $12.50.
Ross: Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh,
wood-burning ovens?
Caitlin: No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Ross: Gas? Wow! Intense.
Chandler: (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a
problem.
Ross: (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Caitlin: (wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible,
horrible place) Yeah.
Ross: They put that in.
Caitlin: What?!
Ross: The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a
leak.
Caitlin: (getting more desperate to leave) Well okay!
Ross: A lot of other gas smells…
Chandler: Oh the humanity.
Ross: Meth-methane smells…
Caitlin: Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Ross: Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Caitlin: Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one
is on me! (Runs for her life.)
(Ross closes the door slowly.)
Ross: (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
Chandler: More so than anything else.
Phoebe: I-I-I found it interesting.
Rachel: I'm sorry.
Ross: Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will
be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
Rachel: Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple
of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
Phoebe: (walking over to Ross) Ross?
Ross: Yeah?
Phoebe: What else do they add smell too?
[Scene: The street outside the building, Rachel is running to catch up with Caitlin.]
Rachel: Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs?
The ones with all the pizza?
Caitlin: Oh, is there a problem?
Rachel: No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually
umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Caitlin: Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Rachel: Yeah.
Caitlin: Wow!
Rachel: I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past
that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Caitlin: The guy with the gas?!
Rachel: Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and
he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Caitlin: Really?!
Rachel: Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Caitlin: I just, I thought Joey was there.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey's grandmother are still
watching Law & Order.]
Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and
uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Ross: What do you mean?
Rachel: Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
Ross: And she just gave you this?
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Rachel: I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Ross: Well that I can believe.
Rachel: Yay!
Joey: (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?
Chandler: Almost over man.
Joey: (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the
Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)
Chandler: Why am I looking?
Joey: Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
(Joey has made a little home movie that's his big scene. He braces himself against the
door to his apartment and while holding a plastic gun and wearing the same sweater
says…)
Joey: (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Grandma Tribbiani: Oh Joey!
Joey: That's right!
Chandler: You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Joey: (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The
duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000
in small bills, and if I don't get it…(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't
get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Phoebe: Oh no!
Joey: (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the
gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
Ross: (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
Grandma Tribbiani: Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)
(Suddenly, the tape cuts away from Joey's impromptu scene, to Chandler standing really,
really close to the camera.)
Chandler: (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing
countdown…engines…on!
(Joey and Chandler both run to shut off the tape.)
Joey: (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Phoebe: I am definitely gonna watch that!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, another time lapse, Monica is seeking advice from Rachel
and Phoebe about possible replacement earrings.]
Monica: What about these? These look the same?
Phoebe: Definitely!
Monica: Not as each other! 
Phoebe: Oh, then no.
(Goes over to Chandler.)
Chandler: (To Monica) Hey!
Monica: Hi!
Chandler: You ready?
Monica: Yeah.
Chandler: You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Monica: Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Chandler: Let me see the earrings.
Monica: Oh, honey, the earrings…
Chandler: (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best
taste or what?
Monica: My boyfriend really does have good taste!
(He turns to get his coat and Monica gives Rachel and Phoebe two thumbs up as Chandler
walks over to Ross.)
Chandler: (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Ross: Hm-mmm.
EndChandler: Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is kneeling at the coffee table and has a bunch of
pictures laid out in front of her as Rachel enters.]
Rachel: Hey!
Monica: Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally
organize these photos!
Rachel: Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Monica: Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got
holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've
cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays
and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)
Rachel: Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Monica: You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Rachel: Great! Thanks!
Monica: All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Rachel: Okay. 
(She picks up the box and the bottom falls out, spilling all of the pictures onto
Monica's neat little piles.)
Rachel: Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Monica: I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype. 
Rachel: Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix
you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross: Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Rachel: No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you
get all the margarita stuff ready.
Monica: All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some
cash.
Rachel: Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Monica: Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…
Rachel: What?!
Monica: What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! 
(Rachel slowly leaves the apartment.)
[Scene: Gary's cop car, Ross is in the front seat with Gary of course. Chandler is in
the back seat.]
Ross: (to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
Chandler: It is starting to get dark out there.
Ross: (to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Gary: Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Chandler: (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
(Gary reaches up to grab that little light that cops have for unmarked cop cars.)
Ross: Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Gary: It's called the cherry.
Ross: It's the—Chandler!!
(Chandler starts laughing at his joke.)
Joey: (returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich
in the world!
Gary: Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Joey: Oh-ho, yeah!
Gary: Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Joey: Yep!
Gary: Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Joey: (dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for
this car.
Chandler: Your tax dollars?
Joey: Yeah, okay.
[Time lapse, they're still on the ride along and Joey is just sniffing his sandwich.]
Chandler: (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich
really does smell good.
Joey: Did I say you could smell it?!
Chandler: I can't smell your sandwich?
Joey: Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Chandler: Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey
just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Joey: Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Chandler: Okay.
Joey: Are you thinking about Monica?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Yeah, what's that like?
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Rachel is just entering. She takes off her coat and heads for
the kitchen. As she does, she knocks something off of a bookcase next to the kitchen door
with her coat and it breaks.]
Rachel: Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the
stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and
finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone
rings.)
Monica: (on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!
(Rachel runs over and answers the phone with the blender in hand.)
Rachel: Hey! What's up?!
Monica: I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt,
some margarita mix, and tequila.
Rachel: So all we have is ice?
Monica: See if he has ice.
Rachel: Okay.
(She hangs up the phone and starts to head back to the kitchen and notices some money
lying out, stops, reaches down to pick it up, the phone rings causing her to drop it, she
quickly puts it back, and heads for the kitchen.)
Emily: (on answering machine) Hello Ross? It's Emily. (Rachel runs back into the
room with the tequila.) I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married
tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a
mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you
are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Rachel: Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
[Scene: The ride along.]
Ross: So where are we going next?
Gary: This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise
him coming home.
Chandler: Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Joey: Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes
a little bit before he lawyers up?
Gary: It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Ross: Yeah, no one talks like that!
Joey: Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Ross: Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Chandler: How do you figure that?
Ross: Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Chandler: Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Ross: Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
Gary: Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Ross: Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)
Gary: Ross!
Ross: Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there
flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
(Gary just glares at him.)
[Time lapse, Ross has been demoted to the back seat with Joey and Chandler. He's not
too happy about it.]
Chandler: Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Joey: Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Rachel is playing Emily's message to Monica.]
Emily: (on answering machine) Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not,
but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Monica: (does Rachel's) Nooo!
Rachel: (does Monica's) I know!
Monica: Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Rachel: What?! We can't do that!
Monica: We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back
and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling,
neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Rachel: Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know
that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right
to erase his message!
Monica: I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come
on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?
Rachel: I don't think he's the one who needs help.
(They both sit down.)
Monica: No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about
running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what
she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's
he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I
mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine,
all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same
people.
Rachel: Ugh!
Monica: Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to
play on him.
Rachel: Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!
I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)

Answering Machine: Your messages have been erased.
Rachel: Noooooooo!
[Scene: The ride along, they're all waiting outside of the witness's house and still in
the car in the same places as before.]
Chandler: Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Gary: No. But that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this.
Ross: What is it?
Gary: Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap
your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Chandler: (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Gary: Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Ross: What? What? What? What is it?
Joey: Is everything okay?
Chandler: What's going on?
Gary: Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
(They all turn and look away. Suddenly a loud bang sounds out and in slow motion Joey
slowly throws his body over Ross. Gary is shocked at what he sees while Chandler is
obviously hurt.)
Gary: Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. (Joey slowly moves off of
Ross.) Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
Joey: (To Ross) You okay man?
Ross: Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Chandler: Uh, HELLO!!
Joey: Hi.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Monica has all the supplies she needs and is getting ready to
leave.]
Monica: All right, I guess we should go.
Rachel: No, wait. Wait.
Monica: Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
Rachel: No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Monica: There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Rachel: Yeah well unless we tell him.
Monica: Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with
you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of
it.
(The phone rings.)
Rachel: Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Ross: (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this
feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay?
Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
Monica: Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Rachel: Right?
[Scene: Central Perk, the guys are returning from the ride along to find Phoebe already
there.]
Gary: Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
Phoebe: (excited) John Glenn is here?!
Gary: No, Joey!
Ross: Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the
car…
Gary: Wait! Hold on! (He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss.) (To Phoebe)
Hi!
Phoebe: Hi!
Gary: (To Ross) Okay, go ahead.
Ross: Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired.
And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Phoebe: My God, Joey!
Chandler: (pouting) It was a car backfire!
Ross: Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Joey: Yeah, I didn't know that.
Ross: And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Gary: Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like
you.
Chandler: Who jumps at loud noises!
Ross: Wow! I could've died tonight.
Chandler: Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think
I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up
and starts for the door.)
Ross: I do have a newfound respect for life.
Chandler: (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
Gary: (To Phoebe) So you wanna get some dinner?
Phoebe: Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now,
I'd throw my body on you.
Gary: Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad
neighborhood.
Phoebe: Okay!
Gary: All right.
Phoebe: Bye!

Ross and Joey: Bye!
(They leave as Ross stares in awe at Joey.)
Joey: Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the
same day!
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is pacing as Joey enters.]
Joey: Dude! How come you took off? 
Chandler: Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…
Joey: Is something wrong?
Chandler: No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Joey: Okay.
Chandler: You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Joey: That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Chandler: I do not hate Ross!
Joey: Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want
Ross out of the picture.
Chandler: What picture?
Joey: I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Chandler: Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but
y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Joey: Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No!
I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's
not street like us!
Chandler: When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you
would for me. That's the bottom line.
Joey: Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Chandler: From a bullet!
Joey: I know it doesn't make much sense…
Chandler: Much sense?!
Joey: Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Chandler: So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Joey: I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the
sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!
Chandler: So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Joey: No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Chandler: Really?!
Joey: Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich
and holds it out for Chandler) here.
Chandler: Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
Joey: No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
(Chandler takes a bite.)
Joey: How good is that?
Chandler: (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Joey: See?
Chandler: Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
Joey: Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Chandler: I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Joey: Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Rachel is trying to repair the thing she broke earlier, but
gets interrupted by hearing Ross at the door. She panics and throws the thing into the
kitchen. And runs to the couch as Ross enters.]
Rachel: Hey! Hi!
Ross: Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Rachel: Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay?
This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Ross: Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
Rachel: Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Ross: The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had
an actual near death experience!
Rachel: What?! What? What happened?!
Ross: Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? 
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: And somebody took a shot at me!
Rachel: (gasps) Really?!
Ross: No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody
was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this
great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every
opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Rachel: Because a car backfired?
Ross: (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?
Rachel: Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing"
thing but um, Emily called you today.
Ross: You talked to her?
Rachel: No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But
it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.
Ross: Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Rachel: Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and
did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Ross: Wow!
Rachel: Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Ross: Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Rachel: Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because
y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your
decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.
Ross: Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Rachel: Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,
no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really
want to get back into that?
Ross: Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my
ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to
mean something!
Rachel: Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely
an experience!
Ross: You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to
seize! Y'know?
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is
about escaping stuff.
Ross: Huh.
Rachel: I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,
y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with
Emily?
Ross: That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I
really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Rachel: Well, there you go!
Ross: Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Rachel: (laughing) Close call day.
Ross: Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)
Rachel: Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)
Ross: Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. 
Rachel: Oh?
(Ross hits the playback button.)
Ross: (on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Oh
yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Rachel: No. (She heads for the door again.)
Ross: (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica
here?
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah, I want my money back.
Rachel: (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps,
right?
(Ross is stunned.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Ross: Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Phoebe: Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a
good story.
Ross: I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but
heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Monica: Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a
fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you
guys.
Chandler: Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Ross: I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all
of us.
Chandler: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Joey: Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)
Phoebe: Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in
any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you
all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.
(Joey gets all happy with himself, while the rest of the gang is less than enthused.)
EndRachel: All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna
like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I
was a little girl.
Ross: You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Rachel: Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? 

Joey and Ross: Yeah!
Rachel: Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross
stares in shock.) Check it out!
(Joey turns and looks at quite possibly one of the ugliest pets that you can possibly
buy on the planet. Rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. Yep, a hairless cat! Joey and
Ross start to get sick.)
Ross: What-what is it?!
Joey: What the hell is that?!!
Rachel: It's a, it's a cat!
Joey: That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Rachel: Yes it is!
Ross: Why is it inside out?!
Rachel: Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Ross: How much did you pay for that?
Rachel: Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Ross: Yeah? How much?
Rachel: A thousand bucks.
Ross: ON A CAT??!!!!
Joey: It's not a cat!
Rachel: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a
little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap
and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Ross: Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little
political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to
buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably
won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you
want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly
scheduled programming.}
Joey: It's not a cat!
Rachel: Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care
what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both
glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
(Rachel goes into the bathroom as the guys continue throwing the ball.)
Ross: (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how
long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Joey: Uhh, the ball thing.
Ross: Yeah?
Joey: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without
dropping it?!
Ross: Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Joey: Okay!
(They throw the ball back and forth once.)
Joey: (catches the ball) Uh-oh.
Ross: What?
Joey: I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
[Cut to Chandler and Joey's, Ross is seen throwing the ball into the bathroom,
presumably where Joey is currently using the facilities.]
Joey: Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Ross: I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?
[Scene: the 5th Precinct, Gary's precinct, Chandler has come to talk to him
about commitment. And as he's walking through the door he notices a couple of "Ladies
of the night" sitting there. (If you know what I mean.)]
Chandler: Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
Gary: Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Chandler: Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Gary: Yeah?
Chandler: It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Gary: (laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?
Chandler: Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with
you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Gary: Sure. Okay.
Chandler: Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Gary: Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Chandler: You mean scared.
Gary: No, I mean happy.
Chandler: Scared? Happy?
Gary: Chandler, what-what are you doing?
Chandler: I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived
with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to
bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Gary: I know! I can't wait!
Chandler: Were you're parents happy, or something?
Gary: Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find
someone that I really love. I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Chandler: Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Gary: So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Chandler: Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in
with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Gary: No, it's too soon for you guys.
Chandler: (pause) Yeah, you're right about that.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are still playing catch.]
Ross: …now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they
discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!
How did it get there?!
{Y'know, sometimes I think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to
trip me up. But it won't work. I'll always have the last laugh! <manical_laugh.wav>
Okay, so maybe I'm a little deluded, it's probably just my spellchecker. But, I must admit
I did get Mesozoic and Paleozoic on the first attempt. Yay me! Anyhoo…}
Joey: Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
{Oh, all right!  Geez, I can't have any fun!}
Monica: (entering) Hey guys!
Joey: Hi!
Monica: Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)
It was right here, where is it?
Joey: I don't know.
Monica: All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Ross: How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Monica: Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and
just help me find it!
Joey: Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.
(He throws it back to Ross, but it's intercepted by Monica and the guys both scream in
horror.)
Monica: What?!
Ross: Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Joey: Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… (Looks to Ross.)
Ross: 2 hours, 27 minutes.
Monica: Really?!
[Time lapse, Monica has joined in and is calling to get out of work.]
Monica: (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into
work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it
way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick
again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up
and keeps throwing the ball.)
(Rachel enters.) 
Ross: Hey Rach!
Rachel: Hey.
Ross: Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Rachel: Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Monica: Rach?
Rachel: Yeah?
Monica: You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are
covered with scratches.)
Rachel: Well, it's my cat.
Monica: (shocked) What?!
Rachel: Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Monica: I don't want a cat!
Joey: Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean,
it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it
just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Ross: Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Monica: (To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me
300!!
Rachel: Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is drinking coffee as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hi!
Phoebe: Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Chandler: Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Phoebe: What?!
Chandler: He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky
lady.
Phoebe: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing
you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Chandler: I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Phoebe: Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of
here, good for nothing.
Gary: Hey Chandler.
Chandler: Hey Gar!
Gary: (To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe: Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)
Gary: You look very pretty today.
Phoebe: Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)
Gary: Here's the thing.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Gary: Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Gary: Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Phoebe: No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying
still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.) 
Gary: Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Gary: I want you to move in with me.
Phoebe: That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean
there's so much we don't know about each other.
Gary: (disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
Phoebe: I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Gary: (disappointed more) Uh-huh.
Phoebe: I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried
it's gonna be a big mistake.
Gary: (on the verge of tears) Yeah.
Phoebe: Which is why my answer is yes!
Gary: (suddenly happy) Really?!
Phoebe: Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so…happy. (She's not happy.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, and Monica are still playing catch, with
Chandler looking on. Joey throws the ball to Monica who catches it and whips it at Ross.]
Ross: (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same
team!
Chandler: Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Joey: That's right baby.
Chandler: All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the
game.)
Monica: (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Chandler: What?
Monica: He's a dropper!
Joey: Oh yeah, that's right!
Chandler: I'm not a dropper!
Ross: It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Chandler: It's throwing and catching!
Ross: All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
Chandler: Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control
and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
(Rachel enters with the "cat" and the chick and the duck start to get riled
up.)
Joey: Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Monica: Oh my—Oh good God!
Rachel: (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I
don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Ross: Baking it didn't help, huh?
Monica: So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Rachel: I tried! They won't take her back.
Chandler: Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Monica: Rach, why won't they take it back?
Rachel: Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,
what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Monica: Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what
to do with it.
Rachel: No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all
scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)
(Monica sneezes.)
Monica: Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My
vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.
It's okay. Man, that was close.
Chandler: Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.

Phoebe and Gary: (entering) Hey!
All: Hey!
Gary: We have great news!
Phoebe: We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
All: Congratulations! Congrats!
Phoebe: I know, I'm so excited!
Gary: So am I!
Phoebe: Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most
excited!
Gary: Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Phoebe: Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Gary: All right.
(Phoebe closes the door behind him.)
Monica: So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Phoebe: I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do
really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the
money I'll save on stamps.
Monica: Why, do you write him a lot?
Phoebe: No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of
stamps. Don't they?
All: Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
(Rachel enters with the cat, wearing the oven mitt, and startles Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
[Scene: Gary's precinct, Phoebe is entering.]
Gary: Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn
Heights?
Phoebe: No, nothing.
Gary: Oh really?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Gary: Nothing at all?
Phoebe: No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't
have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)
Gary: Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe: Uh-huh!
(He takes her into one of those typical interrogation rooms you see on TV and in the
movies. Which is really appropriate here, since this is a TV show. What are the odds of
that?)
Gary: Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takes
off his coat.)
Phoebe: (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Gary: So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
You-you checked the Post?
Phoebe: Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?
Gary: In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Phoebe: Umm, yeah! Today's.
Gary: 'Cause uh, this is today's Post (produces one from the other chair)
and uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points)
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights,
(points) Brooklyn Heights!
Phoebe: (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just
bragging!
Gary: Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down in
shame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does
so) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said,
"Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone.
Does that sound at all possible to you?
Phoebe: Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have
doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)
Gary: Phoebe…
Phoebe: Yeah?
Gary: Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And
there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything
I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both
our names on the mailbox.
Phoebe: That's so sweet.
Gary: Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine!
We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy
Phoebe: Living with you would make me happy.
Gary: Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Phoebe: No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Gary: Are you sure?
Phoebe: Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
(Hugs him.) 
Gary: Oh that's great!
Phoebe: Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the
glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these
rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!
[Scene: The street outside Central Perk, Rachel is trying to sell the cat.]
Rachel: Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)
Woman No. 1: (looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Rachel: It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Woman No. 1: Eew! It's creepy looking!
Rachel: Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!
(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?
Woman No. 1: (laughs) No, I hate cats.
Rachel: Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All
right? Move on!
(Another woman approaches.)
Woman No. 2: Wow! What an unusual cat!
Rachel: Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Woman No. 2: Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go
to the shelter (Good for her) but… Okay, why not?
Rachel: Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Woman No. 2: What?!
Rachel: Okay, a thousand.
Woman No. 2: I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Rachel: Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more
of an investment than a cat.
Woman No. 2: Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel: (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you
know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call
the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave
the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)
Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her
again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, Monica, and now Chandler are still playing
catch. The guys are exhausted and sitting around the room. Monica is still standing all
pumped up and being hyper-competitive yet again. {Okay! We get it! She's competitive!!
Must we see all the time?!}]
Ross: I'm starving! 
Monica: Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check
time!
Joey: I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented
this game!
Monica: Please! I made this game what it is.
Chandler: Not fun anymore?
Ross: I'm still hungry! 
Monica: All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand
right? Are you with me?
Ross: I am!
Monica: All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys
all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.
[Cut to her apartment where Rachel is sitting at the table.]
Monica: Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Rachel: It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.
Whiskerson.
Ross: Oh, thank God!
Joey: Did you get your money back?
Rachel: Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Monica: Wow! You made a profit!
Gunther: (entering with the cat) I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Rachel: Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)
Gunther: Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime
you want.
Rachel: Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)
Gunther: (To Ross) Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
[Scene: Gary and Phoebe's apartment, it's morning and they're both waking up in bed.]
Gary: I really like waking up with you.
Phoebe: I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a
beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all
day.
Gary: That would be great!
Phoebe: We could have breakfast in bed…
Gary: Wait, just a second. 
Phoebe: Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Hyper-competitive Monica, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Ross
are still playing catch. Monica is finally tiring while the rest of them are totally
exhausted and virtually asleep.]
Monica: All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Phoebe: (entering) Oh good, you're all up.
Rachel: Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, that's over.
All: What?!
Chandler: Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can
work it out!
Phoebe: He shot a bird!
Chandler: Oh that is over!
All: That's terrible! I'm sorry!
Rachel: Phoebe, are you okay?
Phoebe: Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Joey: Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)
Phoebe: (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on
the table and everyone gasps.)
Monica: It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one
needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official
ballplayers can drop the ball!
All: All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending the
game.)
Rachel: Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Monica: Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door
and everyone watches her leave.)
(Pause)
Chandler: You guys wanna eat here?
All: Yeah! As long as we're here!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]
Joey: Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball
around?
Rachel: Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Ross: I know. My arm is killing me.
Rachel: No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)
Chandler: Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything
but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the
phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his
chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)
EndRachel: Hey!

The Doctor: I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't
worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Rachel: So were done then!
Dr. Miller: Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Rachel: Okay.
Dr. Miller: This is a glaucoma test.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller: Sit down.
Rachel: Okay.
Dr. Miller: But your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff of
air in each eye.
Rachel: (jerks back from the tester) What?!
Monica: A small puff of air, now come on!
Dr. Miller: Here we go.
Rachel: All right.
Dr. Miller: 1…2…3! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)
Rachel: I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head
back.) Okay.
Dr. Miller: Ready?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller: 1…2… (She flinches on 2 this time.)
Monica: Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Rachel: Okay.
Dr. Miller: That's okay.
Monica: Okay. (Monica backs off.)
Rachel: Okay. Okay!
Dr. Miller: 1…2! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You're
young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Rachel: (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!
Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at
people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to
flinch and scream at him.)
Dr. Miller: Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want
you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Rachel: Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Dr. Miller: Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Rachel: Great!
Dr. Miller: And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Rachel: Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)
Monica: Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F
D.
Dr. Miller: Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Monica: I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)
(To Rachel) And you don't get one!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, and Joey are there.]
Rachel: Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a
100% better.
Monica: They're still in my coat.
Rachel: Damn!
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey! You ready to go?
Chandler: Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or
will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
(Monica stares at him.)
Chandler: What?
Monica: I love you.
{There's another continuity error here. Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's
holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they
were folding nicely. After she says the line and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can
only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it
was folded sloppily, unlike before. Hey, you notice things while spending this much time
on this!}
Joey: Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Phoebe: Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Chandler: Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big
hotel suite?
Joey: Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a
real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Chandler: I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big
hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Joey: Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right
in Joey's pocket.
Chandler: So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Joey: Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten
years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will
place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Joey: You got it!
Ross: All right!
(Joey nods to Chandler, no way!)
Chandler: All right, bye-bye now!
Phoebe: Bye!
Rachel: Bye you guys!
Joey: Bye-bye!
Monica: I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Chandler: Okay!
Joey: Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Rachel: Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the
puss.
(Pause.)
Joey: See ya! (Walks out.)
Rachel: Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs
after him.)
Ross: Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away)
Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and
she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He
grabs the magazine away from her.)
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Ross: Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please,
tell me what it is I did!
Phoebe: Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Ross: Well, I don't know.
Phoebe: Well, I can't help you.
Ross: Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Phoebe: Apology accepted.
Ross: Okay. So we're, we're good?
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Ross: All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Phoebe: (quietly) Bye, fat ass. 
Ross: ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did
that mad you so mad at me!
Phoebe: I don't know! I don't remember!
Ross: Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Phoebe: Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat
ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. 
(Ross isn't sure what to do with that comment.)
[Scene: Phoebe's cab, Joey and Chandler are headed across the George Washington bridge
on their way to Las Vegas. Joey is driving.]
Joey: Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Chandler: We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road
once.
Joey: Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly
looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!
Chandler: Isn't that Ross's money?
Joey: Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Chandler: I don't know.
Joey: Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a
bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind
Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Chandler: Okay!
Joey: Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Chandler: Too dry.
Joey: Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Chandler: No!
Joey: Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Chandler: No!
Joey: (shocked) What?!
Chandler: Yes.
Joey: Dude you said, "No!"
Chandler: I also said, "Yes!"
Joey: You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Chandler: No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
Joey: I don't believe this!
Chandler: Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Joey: What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Chandler: They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joey: Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all
over my big break.
Chandler: Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Joey: Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if
it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Chandler: Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Joey: Not if you're gonna be like this!
Chandler: All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like
that I'll lie.
Joey: Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Chandler: All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right
now!
Joey: Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound
of numerous car horns.) Get out!
Chandler: You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Joey: Get out!!
Chandler: All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no
sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are there. Ross is trying to
figure out why Phoebe's mad at him.]
Ross: Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Phoebe: No.
Ross: Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Phoebe: No that made me feel precious.
Monica: Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?
Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Ross: Yeah? Sometimes it's… (Does the fist thing.)
Rachel: Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he
starts to lose.
Ross: Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)
Rachel: Eh! Stop it!
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Chandler! What are you doing here?
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
All: Why?!
Chandler: I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where
you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Phoebe: That game should not be played without my supervision. 
Chandler: Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that
uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do
anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he
should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Phoebe: What's in the bag?
Chandler: Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts
that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with
one leg?
Phoebe: I do!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to apply her eye drops while Monica looks
on.]
Rachel: Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only
problem is, it's not over her eye.)
Monica: Not even close.
Rachel: Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Monica: Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Rachel: All right!
Monica: Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)
Rachel: All right.
Monica: Put your head back.
Rachel: Yes!
Monica: All right.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: Now, open your eyes.
Rachel: Okay, they are. (No they're not.)
Monica: How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)
Rachel: (thinks) Four.
Monica: Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Rachel: Really?!
Monica: Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?
Okay?
Rachel: Okay!
Monica: No drops!
Rachel: Great!
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: On three, 1…2…3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the
drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the
eyedropper.)
Rachel: Well, well, you said it was practice!
Monica: Then why did you move?!
Rachel: Because I knew you were lying!
Monica: All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by
her legs.)
Rachel: (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!
Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
Monica: I am going… I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her
stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.) 
Rachel: Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
(Monica starts biting on the eyedropper, spraying the fluid all over. But Rachel keeps
turning her head back and forth and Monica keeps missing.)
Rachel: Monica! Stop it!
Monica: (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!
Rachel: Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a
fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu� pose,
at least for primetime TV.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse, Phoebe and Monica are playing cards as the
phone rings.]
Phoebe: Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!
Monica: (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's
proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.
Y'know he's really upset about it.
Joey: (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests!
Monica: What did you do to his sweater vests?
Joey: Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica
listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Monica: Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Hey, dude!
Joey: Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.
What-what is it?
Phoebe: Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks
Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)
Chandler: (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!
I wanna talk to him!
Phoebe: Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering… (We hear the dial
tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Chandler: Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?
Monica: Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las
Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Chandler: That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of
porn…
Phoebe: No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Chandler: Really?
Phoebe: Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that
why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Ross: (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay,
clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Ross: What do you like better flora or fauna?
Phoebe: Fauna.
Ross: Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Phoebe: Garfunkle.
Ross: Why are you mad at me?
Phoebe: You said I was boring--Ohh!
Ross: When did I say you were boring?!
Phoebe: Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Ross: Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Phoebe: Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing
chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron
Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
[Scene: The desert outside of Las Vegas, Joey is arriving and we hear the song, Name.
Y'know, (singing) I've been through the desert on a horse with no name! It felt good to
be out of the rain. In the desert, you can't remember your name, 'cause there ain't no one
for to give you no pain. La…la…la-la-la, la, la, la, la-la-la. You get the
idea. Anyhoo, he pulls up and stops. As he gets out of the car, he spills a huge pill of
fast food containers out of the foot well.]
Joey: Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Stanley: Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Joey: Wh-what?! Why?!
Stanley: It's a money thing, we don't have any.
Joey: (laughs) You're kidding right?
Stanley: No.
Joey: What?!
Stanley: It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money
soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Joey: Uh, hang out?! How long?
Stanley: I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will
always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
Joey: No!
Stanley: Eh, worth a shot. (Gets into his car.) Look Joey, let me know where
you're staying, okay? (The car peels away.)
(I think one of the grips walk up to Joey, mainly because there's a credit for The
Grip. What the heck is a grip anyway?!)
The Grip: Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Joey: Yeah.
The Grip: These got left for ya. (He hands him a bunch of helium balloons.)
Joey: Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your
big break. 
(The rest of the crew start to drive away leaving Joey sad, alone, and holding his
congratulatory balloons as the song comes up again. La-la-la. See, I've been through
the desert on a horse with no name! It felt good to be out of the rain! In the desert you
can't remember your name, 'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La-la-la, la,
la, la…)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the phone is ringing.]
Monica: (answering it) Hello?
Joey: (on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Monica: Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Joey: Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Monica: Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Joey: Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want
you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta
go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here! 
[Cut to Joey hanging up the phone in Vegas. He's wearing a Roman gladiator's uniform
and goes over to join a family to pose for a picture. You see, he's apparently taken a job
at Caesar's Palace.]
Joey: (to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.

The Husband: Okay!
Joey: Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your
stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me
now.
Ending Credits
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The gang is surrounding Rachel at key positions.]
Ross: Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Rachel: Yep!
(As she moves to get it, Monica yells…)
Monica: Go!!
(Phoebe jumps to the floor as Ross tackles Rachel off of the couch. Chandler helps push
Rachel onto the floor by jumping over the back of the couch. Phoebe grabs Rachel's head to
hold it still and opens Rachel's eye as Monica jumps onto Chandler's back to administer
the torture--I mean medicine.)
Rachel: What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Monica: Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone
climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Rachel: Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)
End[Cut back to Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel is singing along with a song and
dancing while facing the big picture window. Y'know, I think I'd pay real good money to be
on the other side of that window!]
Rachel: (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!
(There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to
answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks
through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's
leaning against the door jam.) 
Ross: Hey.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the scene is continued from where we left off before the
break.]
Ross: May I come in?
Rachel: Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Ross: Do you want me too?
Rachel: Yeah, sure?
Ross: So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes
off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.)
This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the
question of "Us." (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off
his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)
Rachel: And um, what-what is that Ross?
Ross: The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)
Rachel: (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?
Ross: Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your
nakedness?
Rachel: (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Ross: You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Rachel: Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with
you?!
Ross: No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other
one and heads for the door.)
Rachel: Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Ross: Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Rachel: Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Ross: Thank you.
Rachel: Yes.
Ross: All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)
Rachel: Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the
question of "us?"
(Ross storms off embarrassed.)
[Scene: Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas, the Strip, slot
machines, a couple other gaming tables all set to the tune of you guessed it, Money.
Anyhoo, we finally get through that and watch Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe enter Caesar's
Palace carrying their luggage.]
Phoebe: Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much
better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak
and lobster dinner. Huh!
Monica: Phoebe, you don't eat animals. 
Phoebe: For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle
down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in
his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!
Chandler: Oh my God.
Phoebe: Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.)
Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)
Joey: Hi!
Chandler: Love your condoms my man.
Joey: What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Phoebe: Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Joey: Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a
gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut?
Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Monica: Who are you talking too?
Joey: They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him.
Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work
here.
Chandler: Why?! What happened?!
Joey: Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working
here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Monica: I'm so sorry.
Joey: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.
Chandler: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't
have to share everything with everybody.
Monica: I knew you were not okay with that.
Phoebe: So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Joey: Yeah, what-what's going on?
Phoebe: Monica had lunch with Richard.
Joey: Dawson?! 
Phoebe: Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Chandler: No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Monica: It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not
trust me?
Chandler: When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about
it!
Monica: You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Chandler: Thanks. (They hug.)
Joey: Aww, there we go.
Phoebe: I love Vegas!
Monica: I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Chandler: (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
Joey: Ooh, so close.
Chandler: There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Monica: I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Chandler: That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Monica: Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really,
I don't even want to be around you.
Chandler: Fine with me!
Monica: Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Joey: Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big
misunderstanding.
Monica: No it is not!
Chandler: What are you talking…
Joey: Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)
[Scene: An aircraft cabin, Ross and Rachel are on their way to Vegas.]
Rachel: (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm
going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not
an invitation to the physical act of love.
Ross: (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!
Rachel: I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Ross: Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Rachel: No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Ross: Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Rachel: Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that
easily.
Ross: What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Rachel: No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Ross: Is that so?
Rachel: Yeah.
(Pause.)
Ross: (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you
want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel
sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
[Scene: Chandler's hotel room, he's sitting there with Joey who's talking about his
helmet and running his hand through that feathery thing at the top.]
Joey: Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Chandler: Really?
Joey: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They
would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get
dirty so they would stick it right…
Chandler: (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe
this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Joey: All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a
hundred bucks today.
Chandler: Whoa!
Joey: Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.
Can you believe that? $5,000!
Chandler: Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body
and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
Joey: Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and
turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie
going again!
Chandler: Good luck! 
Joey: Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Chandler: I see.
(Joey exits as Chandler shakes his head.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: The casino bar, Phoebe and Monica are sitting at the bar, while Wayne Newton's
signature song Danke Schoen is playing in the background.]
Monica: (to the bartender) Thank you.
Phoebe: Thanks.
Monica: I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Phoebe: Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with
Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so
sorry.
Monica: This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna
see Richard again.
Phoebe: So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him
that you're sorry and that you love him.
Monica: Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to
find Chandler.)
Phoebe: Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas,
number one!
[Cut to the casino, Monica is walking through it past the craps table when she notices
a chip on the floor. She picks it up and heads to the table.]
Monica: Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes
her head no.)
The Croupier: Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The
woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won
and doubled the chip.)
Monica: Hmm.
[Scene: An airplane cabin, Ross and Rachel are both reading as a guy stops by their
row.]
Guy: (To Rachel) So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. (Ross
giggles.)
Rachel: Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
(Ross keeps giggling and Rachel decides upon revenge. She gets up and kisses the rather
large man in the seat in front of Ross on the back of his head. The guy turns around
angrily.)
Rachel: Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really
likes you.
[Time lapse, Ross is drinking something and decides to get Rachel again.]
Ross: (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who
had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)
[Time lapse, Rachel pushes the flight attendant call button, takes Ross's drink, and
spills it into his lap.]
Ross: What the? What…
Rachel: (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds
after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't
real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants
would be dry.) Hi! 
The Flight Attendant: Miss? May I help you?
Rachel: Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to
have had a little accident.
[Scene: Caesar's Palace Casino, Joey is approaching one of the blackjack tables
on his quest to make enough money for his movie.]
Joey: (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)
Blackjack Dealer: Changing one hundred! (Gives him the change.) Good luck sir.
Joey: (betting all 100) Let's ride.
Blackjack Dealer: (Deals the cards) 13.
Joey: Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but
when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his
hand next to the dealer's hand.)
[Cut to Chandler's room, Joey is relaying to Chandler his amazing discovery.]
Joey: Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical
hand twin!
Chandler: (totally confused) What?
Joey: My identical hand twin!
Chandler: What's an identical hand twin?
Joey: What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was
incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at
my hands in a mirror!
Chandler: Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
Joey: Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Chandler: (totally confused) How?
Joey: Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!
Come on! Identical hands!
Chandler: Again I must go back to, how?
Joey: This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much
would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?
Chandler: (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Joey: Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Chandler: No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.
Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
(Joey starts to leave to embark on his genius moneymaking scheme, but is freaked out
slightly when as he goes to open the door, there's a mysterious knock. He calms himself
down and opens the door to reveal Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Pheebs!!
Phoebe: Yeah?
Joey: I found my identical hand twin!
Phoebe: Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did
you guys make up?
Chandler: No!
Phoebe: But she just came up here!
Chandler: That was Joey!
Phoebe: I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Chandler: Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Phoebe: Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she
came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Chandler: Really?
Phoebe: Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta
find her.
Chandler: Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
Phoebe: Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks
herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!
[Scene: Caesar's Palace Casino, Chandler is looking for Monica while Tom Jones's
signature song is playing in the background (Getting the theme yet? Tom Jones, Wayne
Newton, casinos… They're in Vegas people! Catch up!) It's Not Unusual, y'know,
"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone! It's not unusual to have fun with anyone!
  But when I see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry!
  I wanna die." Well, while that's playing he spots Monica playing craps and
in victory hug the guy next to her. Chandler turns and walks out.]
[Scene: That same plane cabin, Ross is working on a crossword puzzle and Rachel is
asleep against his shoulder. She shifts a little bit and Ross suddenly gets an idea. An
evil idea when he looks at his pen. Then we have a little time lapse, the plane has landed
and everyone is disembarking. The flight attendant is saying bye-bye to everyone.]
The Flight Attendant: (to another passenger) Welcome to Las
Vegas.
(Rachel approaches and we see the fruits of Ross's evil plan. He has drawn a moustache
and beard on Rachel. The flight attendant just ignores it.)
The Flight Attendant: (To Rachel) Thank you! (Not sure of
herself) Enjoy your flight?
Rachel: Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)
The Flight Attendant: (To Ross) Hope you had a nice flight.
Ross: Ohh, it was the best!
Commercial Break
[Scene: The casino, Ross and Rachel are entering.]
Ross: I think the check in is that way. (Points)
Rachel: Ahh.
(A young boy sees Rachel, points, and starts laughing.)
Rachel: Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents
drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.
Phoebe: (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!
Ross: Phoebe! (They hug.) 
Phoebe: You guys are here! Yay!
Rachel: Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)
Phoebe: (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess
umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the
slot machine Phoebe was just at.)
Rachel: Pancho Vila?
Phoebe: Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's
"make-up.")
Rachel: What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't…
(She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew
on me?!
Ross: Hey, you wet my pants!
Phoebe: Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Rachel: Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I
can—you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)
Ross: Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction.
Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
(The old lady at Phoebe's machine wins. Phoebe turns around in shock.)
Phoebe: Ugh!
Ross: What?
Phoebe: That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Ross: Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Phoebe: M-M-Mole people?
Ross: What? No-no, a lurker.
Phoebe: Oh. What's a lurker?
Ross: Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits
for you to give up and then…
Phoebe: Kills you?
Ross: No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Phoebe: Ohhh!
Ross: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: How do you know about this?
Ross: My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate
lessons.
Phoebe: Dance karate?
Ross: Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a
little dance-type sway.)
Rachel: (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't
come off!
Ross: What?!
Rachel: It won't come off!
Ross: Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Rachel: No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Joey: (entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Ross: Joey!!
Joey: All right! Hey-hey!
Rachel: Hi!!
Joey: Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her
purse.)
Ross: (To Joey) Thanks man.
Rachel: Hi. (She hugs Joey.)
Ross: Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Joey: No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand
twin!
Ross: Your what?
Joey: My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This
thing is a gold mine!
Ross: What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Joey: Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live
with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the
thumb.
[Scene: The craps table, Monica is on a big roll.]
Monica: All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Chandler: (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
Monica: Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Chandler: What does it look like? I'm going home.
Monica: What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after
him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was
trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I
won't! He means nothing to me!
Chandler: Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a
naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
Monica: Not any more.
Chandler: Really?!
Monica: Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going
home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is
empty.
Chandler: Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
[Scene: A blackjack table, it's the same one Joey's hand twin was working at, only he's
not there anymore and has been replaced by a beautiful woman.]
Joey: (entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
The Woman Dealer: Which guy?
Joey: He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his
hand.) See?
The Woman Dealer: I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was
here before me just went to the bathroom.
Joey: Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?
The Woman Dealer: Very busy.
Joey: Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's hotel room, Rachel is still trying to get the ink off and
Ross is on the phone to the company. Wait a minute, why exactly are they sharing a hotel
room? Didn't they like break-up or something? Did I miss a memo? Or maybe, it's just
foreshadowing things to come. Who knows? Maybe the answer's at the bottom of the page.
Then again, maybe it isn't and it's just one of those things TV writers just don't
explain. Anyhoo…]
Ross: (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you.
(Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know
it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway,
umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's
worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens)
Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the
phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.
Rachel: What?! What else did he say?
Ross: Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So…(Rachel stares at him.) Okay,
look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all
about it.
Rachel: Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like
this!
Ross: Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Rachel: Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Ross: Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't
have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you.
Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and
glares at him.) There are tons…of…freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one
will notice, I swear!
(They both exit.)
[Time lapse, they're both entering.]
Ross: Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Rachel: Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
Ross: Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel
glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge
and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big
drink! 
Rachel: (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.)
Macadamia nut?
Ross: (looking at the price list) Umm… Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Rachel: Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)
Ross: Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Rachel: Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in
another direction.)
[Scene: The casino, Phoebe is playing on a slot machine. Suddenly the lurker sticks her
head around the aisle of slot machines.]
Phoebe: (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get!
(She throws a quarter at her.)
Chandler: (arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe: Ohh! You made up!
Monica: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Chandler: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)
Phoebe: Ohh, get a room.
Monica: We have one.
Phoebe: I know. Use it.
[Scene: The Men's room, Joey is entering and sees his hand twin washing his hands.]
Joey: Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's
right, you take good care of those babies!
Joey's Hand Twin: Excuse me?
Joey: It's me, Joey!
Joey's Hand Twin: Do I know you?
Joey: (holds up his hand) Joey!
Joey's Hand Twin: Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Joey: Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Joey's Hand Twin: Nothing?
Joey: Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with
it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna
talk to us!
Joey's Hand Twin: (tries to leave) I have to get back to…
Joey: (stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show!
Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a
song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your
hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!

Joey's Hand Twin: That's okay. (Walks out.)
Joey: (following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's room, Ross is drinking a beer while Rachel is examining
herself in the mirror.]
Rachel: Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Ross: (gets up) All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We
can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come
on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.
Rachel: Hit me!
Ross: (does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at
this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)
Rachel: I bet 20.
Ross: You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)
[Scene: The Craps Table, Monica is still on her roll, only this time Chandler's with
her and she has a huge crowd of people around.]
Monica: (shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the
dice.) Yes!
Chandler: Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Monica: That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Chandler: Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Monica: Pick a number! That is your only job!
Chandler: 8. 8!
Monica: Thank you!
Chandler: If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
All: Yay!!
The Croupier: 8!
Monica: Yes!
All: Yay!!
Monica: (To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are
we?
Chandler: Noo!
Monica: Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Chandler: Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Monica: What?
Chandler: Two fours.
Monica: Okay. (Rolls the dice) 
The Croupier: 8!: 
A Drunken Gambler: (To Chandler) Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Chandler: Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get
the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions
to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
Monica: All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)
Chandler: (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were
fighting about!
Monica: Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich—Me neither! Okay, what do
I want now?
Chandler: Another hard 8.
Monica: Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Chandler: Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and
we get married here tonight.
Drunken Gambler: Go! Come on! Roll!
All: Roll-roll!!
Monica: Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Commercial Break
[Scene: The Craps table, continued from earlier.]
Monica: What did you just say?
Chandler: You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Monica: Are you serious?!
Chandler: Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Monica: I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Chandler: Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
{Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I
guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Monica: Okay!
Chandler: Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
(She rolls the dice, but one bounces out of the table.)
Chandler: (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Drunken Gambler: It went under the table.
Monica: Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Chandler: All right! 
(He searches to his right; she searches to her left. They're both on their hands and
knees when they spot the die. It's propped up against the table leg, and it's not lying
flat. Both the four and the five are showing.)
Chandler: Here it is! Here it is!
Monica: That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
(Pause.)
Chandler: It's a four.
Monica: I think so too.
(Cue up the music as they move in and kiss. This time I think it's Perry Como, but I'm
not sure. It's Everybody loves somebody, sometime! Everybody falls in love somehow!
Something in your kiss, just told me, my sometime, is now!)
[Scene: The slot machines, Phoebe is still feeding quarters into the one-armed bandit
as the lurker peeks over the top of the machines.]
Phoebe: Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker
scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her
in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!
The Lurker: I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond
hair!
(They start smacking each other's cups, but Phoebe notices a security guard
approaching.)
Phoebe: Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard
walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking
days are over!
The Lurker: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on
to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be
on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do
you leave?
The Lurker: Also Monday.
Phoebe: What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's room, they've pretty much consumed the entire mini-bar.
Needless to say, they're feeling no pain and are still playing blackjack.]
Rachel: Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit
me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with
each one.)
Ross: (runs out of cards) We need more cards.
Rachel: Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but
stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without
dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We
would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
(They both start laughing. There's a knock on the door.)
Ross: That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.) 
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)
Rachel: Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)
Joey: Hi!
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have
to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Ross: I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to
sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it.
Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are
you, are you okay?
Joey: Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)
Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Rachel: I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Joey: Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)
Ross: Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Rachel: Ohhh!!
Ross: (he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the
bed.)
Rachel: Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Ross: I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I…I really miss downstairs.
Rachel: Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
[Cut to the casino, a very drunk and doodled on Rachel is walking arm in arm with an
equally drunk and doodled on Ross are walking through the casino and greeting people on
their way through. Ross has some whiskers and his nose colored in, along with his name on
his forehead.] 
Ross: Well hello! I'm Ross!
Rachel: Good luck to ya!
Ross: Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the
corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
(They've made their way to the statue of the naked man that Chandler was leaning
against earlier.)
Rachel: Wow!
Ross: (bowing) Hello!
Rachel: (bowing) Hello!

Ross and Rachel: (bowing) Hello!
(They both continue on and Ross meows like a cat.)
[Scene: The slot machines, we see some guy not having any luck. Both Phoebe and the
Lurker are lurking him and each stick their heads around the corner at different times
This is all set to that Pink Panther song. Finally the guy gives up and walks past
the lurker's position, thus giving her the advantage. She scurries in and quickly drops a
coin in the slot before Phoebe gets there. Phoebe arrives slightly later and pulls the arm
just after the lurker deposits the coin and wins.]
Phoebe: I won! I won! I finally won!
The Lurker: I won! That was my quarter!
Phoebe: Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)
(The security guard approaches.)
The Lurker: (to the guard) Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter,
this is my money. (Motions to the jackpot.)
The Security Guard: (To Phoebe) Is that true miss?
Phoebe: (quietly) Sells drugs to kids.
The Security Guard: What?!
Phoebe: She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)
The Lurker: It was my quarter!
The Security Guard: (To Phoebe) Was it her quarter?
Phoebe: How about we talk about this over dinner?
The Security Guard: Okay lady, you're out of here.
Phoebe: No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to
that hell hole!!
The Security Guard: I'm just taking you outside!
Phoebe: Oh, okay. (Walks out.)
[Scene: The Gift Shop, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Monica: Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something
new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Chandler: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue
sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Monica: You're so efficient. I love you! 
Chandler: Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Monica: No-no-no! We need something old!
Chandler: Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Monica: That'll work!
Chandler: I don't think so.
Monica: Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Chandler: (looks around) Here just…take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
Monica: That's stealing!
Chandler: No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
(She does so and it makes her look pregnant.)
Monica: Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
Chandler: Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
[Scene: A blackjack table, Joey is moving in to try and get his hand twin (who's
dealing) to join him in his evil plot to rule the world! "Join me, and together we'll
rule the universe as father and son!" (Sorry, I had a little Star Wars creep
in there—Ooh, I have a big spoiler for The Phantom Menace, Yoda lives at the
end! Ha-ha, spoiled it! Now you don't have to see it!)]
Joey: (sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)
Joey's Hand Twin: Are you gonna play?
Joey: No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway… (Shakes his
hands.)
Joey's Hand Twin: You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Joey: (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold
it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking
at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho!
(The dealer stares at him and he stops.)
Phoebe: (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina
Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks
down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Joey's Hand Twin: (To Joey) 14.
Joey: Hit me! (He does so.)
Phoebe: Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same
hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Joey's Hand Twin: Stop it!
Joey: Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at
this table?
Joey's Hand Twin: Please stop it!
Joey: Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some
type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Joey's Hand Twin: (To Joey) If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give
it too you!
(The security guard from before approaches and Phoebe tries to turn her back on him.) 
The Security Guard: (To Phoebe) Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Phoebe: No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
The Security Guard: Come on, lady! (Starts to escort her out.)
Joey's Hand Twin: Please, please take him too. (Motions to Joey.)
Joey: Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by
the guard) I'm your hand twin!!
[Scene: A Little White Chapel, Chandler and Monica are entering.]
Chandler: Hello! One marriage please!
Monica: Yep, we wanna get married! 
The Attendant: Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.

Chandler and Monica: All right.
(They both sit down.)
Chandler: (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Monica: What are you doing?
Chandler: Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Monica: No, only because that's the graduation song.
(The real Wedding March begins playing from behind the closed doors of the
chapel.)
Chandler: Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get
married!
Monica: Are you sure you wanna do this?
(Suddenly the doors burst open, and ROSS AND RACHEL COME OUT ARM-IN-ARM!!!!! And
Rachel's carrying a bouquet!!! THEY GOT MARRIED!!!!)
Ross: Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
Rachel: Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
(They storm out into the street.)
Rachel: Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
(She goes one way; he goes the other. The camera pans back to Chandler and Monica, and
needless to say, they're standing there dumbstruck as The King's (Elvis Presley to the
yougin's) Viva, Las Vegas begins to play. Sing along with me now, "Viva!
Las Vegas! Vivaaaaaa! Vivaaaaa! Las Vegassssss!!" Fade to Black.)

a season 6, and it'll start again in September. Have a good summer everyone!]Monica: Are you sure you wanna do this?
(Suddenly the doors burst open, and ROSS AND RACHEL COME OUT ARM-IN-ARM!!!!! And

Monica: Whoa!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Joey: (entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Phoebe: Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)
(Chandler and Monica are stunned again.)
Chandler: Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!

Attendant: (scolding them) N-No running in the chapel!
Phoebe: (to her) Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! (Sees
Chandler and Monica standing there.)
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Monica: What are you guys doing here?
Joey: Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
Isn’t that why you guys are here?
Chandler: Yes! Well that-yes.
Monica: Why else would we be here?
Joey: Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Chandler: We actually missed it.
Phoebe: Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run
in the chapel!
Monica: This is insane!
Phoebe: What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a
real marriage.
Chandler: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.
Monica: What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re
married everywhere.
Phoebe: (shocked) Really?! 
Monica: Yeah!
Phoebe: Oh my God!—Eh! Well…

[Scene: Rachel’s hotel room, she’s waking up with a horrendous hangover.]
Rachel: Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and
groans.)
(Suddenly, there’s movement beside her, startling her. It’s Ross! He wakes up
and they both start screaming in terror. Then they both grab their heads having aggravated
their hangovers.)
Ross: Why are we in bed together?
Rachel: I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Ross: (checks) Yeah.
Rachel: Really?!
Ross: No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t
remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Rachel: Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Ross: And we didn’t have sex. 
(Rachel agrees with him and starts to get out of bed.)
Rachel: Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do
anything stupid.
Ross: (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has
"Just Married" written on his back.)
[Scene: The breakfast buffet, Phoebe is already sitting at the table as Joey enters.]
Joey: Mornin’ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been
canceled.
Phoebe: Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Joey: Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5
minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?
Phoebe: What about my cab?
Joey: I don’t need that anymore.
Phoebe: No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Joey: I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.
(Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?
Phoebe: I don’t know, it’s such a long trip.
Joey: It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be
our chance to like renew our friendship.
Phoebe: Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Joey: Sure?
Phoebe: All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped
loving you.
(Chandler and Monica enter.)
Chandler: Hi!
Joey: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Chandler: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Phoebe: Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Joey: Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!
Chandler: It’s a buffet man.
Joey: Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the
buffet table with Chandler in tow.)
Chandler: Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Joey: Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a
huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a
spoonful.)
Chandler: Monica and I almost got married last night.
Joey: Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I
wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say,
"Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Chandler: Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married
yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out
of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.
Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Joey: Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.
Chandler: What?!
Joey: Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything
like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.
[Pan to Monica and Phoebe having the same conversation.]
Monica: How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break
his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.
Phoebe: Well you don’t.
Monica: Yes I do!
Phoebe: Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Chandler: (returning with Joey) Hi.
Monica: Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.
Phoebe: No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. 
(Ross and Rachel enter.)
Ross: Hey!

The Girls: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
(They both sit down and Rachel pours them both some coffee. They’re acting like
nothing’s happened and everyone is just staring at them.)
Ross: What?
Chandler: Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
Rachel: (To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?
Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Ross: Yeah!
Phoebe: Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
(Rachel turns to Ross stunned.)
Monica: Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!
Rachel: (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
Chandler: (not quite sure) You did.
Ross: What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
Rachel: No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!
(They turn to look at each other and suddenly remember that they did in fact get
married.)
Ross: We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
Rachel: Oh my God.
Ross: I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Rachel: No!
Joey: They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get
married in Vegas are drunk!
Phoebe: Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I
can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!
Monica: What are you guys gonna do?
Rachel: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
Chandler: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s
free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.
Ross: Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get
divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment. 
Joey: An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.
Phoebe: Oh-oh, that’s your thing.
Ross: What?
Phoebe: You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy
who gets divorced.
All: Oh yeah!
Ross: No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting
divorced!
Phoebe: Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much
you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna
have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.
[Scene: The casino floor, Chandler and Monica are walking through it.]
Monica: So, what do you think we should do?
Chandler: I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Monica: I know I love you! (They hug.)
Chandler: So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have
all the marriages thing? I love you.
Monica: That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice
decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Chandler: Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so
say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite
sign that we should get married.
Monica: All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we
don’t get married.
Chandler: Sounds great.
Monica: Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
Croupler: Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Monica: Ready?
Chandler: Ready!
Monica: (sarcastic) Come on eight.
Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
(Monica rolls the dice.)
Croupler: Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they’re stunned.)
Monica: Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.
Chandler: That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.
Monica: Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard
eight.
Chandler: That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Monica: I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
Chandler: Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?
Monica: Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to
fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a
clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler
and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)
[Scene: Phoebe’s cab, Phoebe and Joey are driving back. Phoebe is driving while
Joey is sleeping.]
Phoebe: Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come
on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!
Joey: (wakes up) What?!
Phoebe: Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six
hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest
stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you
greedy sleeper!
Joey: All right. All right.
Phoebe: Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the
radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Joey: Really? I don’t…
Phoebe: Sing!!
Joey: (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
[Time lapse, Phoebe is asleep, Joey’s driving and having a hard time staying
awake.]
Joey: (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens
his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
[Time lapse, Phoebe is still asleep only Joey is now passed out next to her and the
car’s still moving. She wakes up, sees Joey, and screams.]
Hitchhiker: (driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is on the couch as Ross enters.]
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, hubby!
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole
annulment thing?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Ross: I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier. Rachel starts laughing.]
Rachel: Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.
Ross: Yes, exactly!
Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Ross: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you
into this more.
Rachel: Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think
you’re kidding.
Ross: I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three
failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Rachel: What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!
Ross: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some
form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box
that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
Rachel: Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We
absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away
from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what
you’re asking of me.
Ross: I’m asking you to do me a favor. 
{Note: Does anyone else want to smack Ross right about now? Raise your hands. Okay, put
them down before you stink out the person next to you.}
Rachel: You are asking me to be your wife!
Ross: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
[Scene: The hallway, Chandler is helping Monica to the door.]
Monica: That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Chandler: Well you did pull his hair.
Monica: He took my snack!
Chandler: I’m not getting into this again!
Monica: Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.
Chandler:  Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.
(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of
Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
Monica: This doesn’t mean anything, does it?
Chandler: No!
Monica: Okay.
[Scene: Phoebe’s cab, she’s driving, Joey’s in the back seat, and the
hitchhiker is riding up front with Phoebe.]
Phoebe: (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a
rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a
killer or something!
Joey: Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Phoebe: Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To
the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!
Hitchhiker: No!
Phoebe: Do you like car games?
Hitchhiker: Yeah, y’know the license plate game?
Phoebe: I love the license plate game!
Joey: Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!
Phoebe: No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the
partition.) 
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make
you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to
keep all the presents!
Rachel: (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I
thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay
married.
Ross: I don’t know if it’s true.
Rachel: Oh b-b-but it is!
Ross: Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of
opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Rachel: Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the
world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I
will!
Ross: All right. All right, I’ll do it.
Rachel: Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any
such thing as an annulment shower?
(Ross turns and leaves.)
[Scene: Phoebe’s cab, it’s the same arrangement as before.]
Hitchhiker: Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Phoebe: Oh, okay.
Hitchhiker: This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
Phoebe: And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the
ball’s pretty much in your court.
Hitchhiker: All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)
Joey: Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to
you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines
on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t
resist that beautiful voice!
Joey: Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your
friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an
important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I
know you.
Phoebe: You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Joey: Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really
good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.
Phoebe: Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Joey: Yes.
Phoebe: Is it a meatball sub?
Joey: That is incredible! You are the master!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are there and Rachel is arranging a
bouquet of flowers, pricks her finger on a thorn, throws the bouquet over her head, and
those you who are quicker than some already know that Monica is the one who catches it.]
Rachel: Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…
Monica: No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!
Rachel: All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)
Chandler: All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I
mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Monica: I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way
things are!
Chandler: Me too!
Monica: I don’t want things to change! Do you?
Chandler: No!
Monica: All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything
stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving
me insane!
Chandler: Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
Chandler: (entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack
here?
Monica: Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Monica: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it
doesn’t make any sense.
Chandler: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m
saying?
Monica: Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Chandler: Me asking is kind of a sign.
Monica: YES!!!!!!!!
Chandler: Okay!!!!!
(And the crowd goes wild! Well, at least the live studio audience.)
Monica: Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Here’s your key (Gets him one.)
Chandler: Oh thanks.
Monica: Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out
and come back in!
Chandler: The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.)
Ready?!
Monica: Ready!
(He tries, but something happens.)
Chandler: Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get
in!
Monica: Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!
Chandler: This is not a sign!
Monica: No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!
Chandler: It’s an old key!
Monica: Oh my God it’s old!
Chandler: I love you!
Monica: I love you!
Chandler: Are you hugging the door right now.
(Pause)
Monica: No.
Chandler: Yeah-yeah, me neither.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are on the couch as Ross enters.]
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Ross: Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.
Rachel: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross: Oh yeah, why not?
Rachel: Pheebs?
Phoebe: No thanks, I’ve already seen one.
Rachel: Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
Ross: Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Phoebe: Always.
Ross: I didn’t get the annulment.
Phoebe: What?!
Ross: We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets
up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: The hallway, Joey is coming up the stairs and sees Chandler trying to open the
lock.]
Joey: What are you doing?
Chandler: The key’s stuck in the lock.
Joey: I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)
Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
Chandler: (trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.
Joey: I’m not finished.
Chandler: Oh.
(Joey goes back into the apartment, runs back into the hallway, throws his shoulder
against the door, and knocks it down off it’s hinges.)
Chandler: Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
(Joey pats him on the stomach and heads to bed.)
EndJoey: Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room
over at my place…
Rachel: Oh, that’s true.
Joey: Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could
stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?
Rachel: Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.
Chandler: Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is reading a magazine, eating a cookie, and drinking some
coffee as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe: Hey.
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Ross: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Phoebe: You didn’t tell her did you?
Ross: No. 
Phoebe: Of course not, because you’re in love with her.
Ross: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so
I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.
I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Phoebe: What do you mean, comforted her?
Ross: It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Phoebe: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Ross: It’s also a sign of friendship.
Phoebe: Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of
Ross’s cookie.)
Ross: (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
Phoebe: Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Ross: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Phoebe: Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her
head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love
when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you’re a
scientist. 
Ross: I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in
my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoebe
raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe
it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Phoebe: (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all
right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.
Ross: (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in
love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Phoebe: Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s
‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love! 
(She goes for his magazine and he grabs it away before she reaches it. But she was only
using the magazine as a decoy because she grabs his cookie and coffee, takes a bite out of
the cookie and drinks some of the coffee.)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are there as Joey enters.]
Joey: Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.
Chandler: Who was it?
Joey: I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message."
Jeez! (Exits.)
Monica: Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be
empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Chandler: Sure!
Monica: Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With
a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could
have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved
staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.
Chandler: Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it
could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space
Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Monica: No.
Chandler: Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting
idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."
Monica: Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk
about it, but no.
Chandler: So, that’s it?
Monica: I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The
beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Chandler: Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
Monica: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Chandler: I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room,
especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Monica: Are you mocking me?
Chandler: No, I’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful
guest room. (Exits.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is coming from across the hall.]
Joey: Hey, what’s up?
Chandler: Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Joey: But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out
today. (Shows him the paper.)
Chandler: (reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,
non-ugly." Nice!
Joey: Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an
interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn
from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than
me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.)
Not just a hat rack my friend!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch staring off into space as Rachel enters.]
Rachel: Pheebs, I have to ask you…
Phoebe: Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.
Rachel: You’re just staring into space.
Phoebe: Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lying
on the table.)
Rachel: This one? (Picks it up.)
Phoebe: It worked!
Rachel: Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I
can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and
starts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It’s
just, there is nothing! The city’s full!
Phoebe: Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) "Two bedroom,
two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…" Oh, yeah, but it’s on
the ground floor.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey.
Ross: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Rachel: Yeah! Why?
Ross: Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going
on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,
you interested?
Rachel: That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love
Warren! Thank you!
Ross: Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that
erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.
(Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number.
Rachel: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank
you! 
(She hugs him and he starts to hug her back but notices the look Phoebe is giving him
and pushes her away.)
Ross: Okay, you go grab it!
Phoebe: I saw it.
Ross: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Phoebe: Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t
admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Ross: Look, I do not re-love her.
Phoebe: I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just
promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.
Ross: Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Rachel: (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already
subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.
Ross: You can live with me.
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: What?!
Ross: What?
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Rachel: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Ross: Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
Rachel: I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank
you!
Ross: Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.
Phoebe: Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,
not stupid.
Rachel: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was
gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!
Ross: Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.
Rachel: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses
him on the cheek and exits.) 
Ross: Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now,
aren’t ya?
Phoebe: No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing
happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her
and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And
that’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,
that’s a lie.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hi.
Monica: Hi.
Chandler: Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a
game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get
girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not
that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see
women…
Monica: Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I’m sorry too.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: Yeah! Oh yes!
Chandler: Ohh.
Monica: Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of
something to do with the room together.
Chandler: That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us
both to enjoy the room.
Monica: Totally!
(They start thinking.)
Chandler: We don’t have to come up with this now.
Monica: Oh good.
Chandler: Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can
make in the living room?
Monica: Changes?
Chandler: Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to
make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
Monica: You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over
here?
Chandler: Is that a problem?
Monica: Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.
Chandler: Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.
Monica: See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.
Chandler: Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything
here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Monica: Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it,
everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh
come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t
match! Where is it gonna go?!
Chandler: In the game room!
Monica: Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Chandler: All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over
the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance
over here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.)
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is interviewing a potential roommate. And yes,
she’s a female, non-smoker and very non-ugly.]
Joey: (exiting from Chandler’s room with the new roommate) Everything on
your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your
friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
The Potential Roommate: Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.
Joey: Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to
really think about your answers. Okay?
Chandler: (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential
roommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
Joey: Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the
apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.
Chandler: Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Joey: That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I’m very safety
conscious.
[Scene: Ross’s Apartment, Rachel is entering and Ross is making some room on the
shelves for his stuff.]
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Rachel: Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler
had a big fight and they’re not moving in.
Ross: What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still
moving in right?
Rachel: No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Ross: What?! Over a stupid room!
Rachel: Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched
‘cause I don’t have to move in here!
Ross: Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering, dragging Chandler, to mediate the
argument between Chandler and Monica.]
Ross: What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a
room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Monica: Ross, we can handle this.
Ross: Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people
I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the
silliness!
Chandler: Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks
him and he joins in.)
Ross: (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you
both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as
you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away
over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Chandler: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for
the love.
Monica: Love is the best medicine.
Chandler: That’s laughter.
Monica: Why do you do it?
Chandler: I don’t know.
Ross: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Chandler: Yeah, I do.
Ross: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?
Monica: Yes.
Ross: (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
(Storms out.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at the counter waiting for Gunther, yep
Gunther’s back, to refill her coffee.]
Gunther: So I understand you’re looking for a place.
Rachel: No-no, I’m staying put.
Gunther: Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Rachel: Why, where are you going?
Gunther: I don’t know.
Ross: (entering) Hey Rach!
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in
again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?
Rachel: Oh wow.
Ross: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Rachel: Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really
appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s
gonna be weird?
Ross: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Rachel: Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Ross: No!
Rachel: No?
Ross: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you
still in that place?
Rachel: No! Not at all!
Ross: Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends
who happen to be roommates.
Rachel: Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Ross: Really?! We are?
Rachel: Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a
girlfriend…
Ross: Ohh! That would be great.
Rachel: But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll
just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger
on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky."
(Laughs.)
Ross: (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn’t think of
that.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is once again being dragged in by Ross so he that
he can try to manipulate the situation so that it’s best for Ross, not necessarily
what’s best for Monica and Chandler.]
Ross: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really
big step! And-and what’s the rush?!
(They both start laughing at him.)
Monica: That’s very funny!
Chandler: He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Ross: No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you
start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!
Monica: Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Ross: Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is
about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel’s
room) could destroy you!!
Chandler: Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Monica: Yeah, no, me neither.
Ross: Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed
attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last
time.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you
move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that’s what you want,
there’s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON’T DO
IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
Monica: You still want to move in together right?
Chandler: Of course!
Monica: Ross didn’t scare you?
Chandler: Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Monica: Come here, I want to show you something!
Chandler: Okay!
(They run to the living room where Monica has moved the chair back (Towards the step),
the coffee table forward (Towards the TV), and taped a square outline on the floor.)
Chandler: Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!
Monica: This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could
see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.
Chandler: Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Monica: Okay!
Chandler: Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Chandler: Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs
and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!
Monica: Oh my God! I love that!
Chandler: Really?!
Monica: Uh, no!!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is singing a new song. Yep, the first new Phoebe song of
season six, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are also there.]
Phoebe: (singing) I found you in my bed! 
                         
How’d you whined up there? 
                         
You are a mystery!
                         
Little black curly hair!
                         
Little black curly hair!
                         
Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly
hair…………

(Applause.)
Phoebe: Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please
give me money so I can buy a computer.
Ross: (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?
Rachel: Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Ross: Fighting?!
Rachel: No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things
out.
Ross: Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?
Rachel: Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street
and make a copy?
Ross: Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
Rachel: Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy,
there’s no turning back.
Ross: Yeah, I’m-I’m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I
change my mind. (She exits)
Joey: Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good
idea?
Ross: I’ve been back and forth.
Joey: Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you
know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!
Ross: Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about
y’know, dating other guys.
Joey: That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy
and you’ll be tellin’ her, "Oh that’s okay. You’ll find
someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Ross: Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.
Joey: I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you
again! Now, is that what you want?
Ross: Is that what I want?
Phoebe: (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.
(Rachel enters.)
Joey: Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier.
Rachel: All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.
Joey: Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)
Ross: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Joey: No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I
know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have
to do that!
Rachel: Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a
minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.
Joey: Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey has The Potential Roommate back for another
interview.]
Joey: (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!
The Potential Roommate: Hi!
Joey: Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of
people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the
finalists!
The Potential Roommate: Great!
Joey: Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure
our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word
and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
The Potential Roommate: I can do that.
Joey: Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
The Potential Roommate: Fight.
Joey: Very good! Okay. G.
The Potential Roommate: String?
Joey: Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
The Potential Roommate: Kitten?
Joey: Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye! (He ushers her
out the door.)
EndPhoebe: You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up
like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel: Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some
really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that
make her a good roommate.
Rachel: Oh really? Like what Monica?
Monica: Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…
Rachel: Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Monica: She lets you borrow them.
Rachel: Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
Monica: Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! (To
Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things
she thinks that I’d like.
Phoebe: What else?
Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Phoebe: That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a
blanket.
Rachel: Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
Monica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was
really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And
now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
Rachel: Oh, it’s gonna be fine.
Phoebe: Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know
what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have
so much fun!!
Rachel: But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.
Phoebe: Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
Monica: Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it
to get a better look.) Oh my God!
[Cut to Ross’s apartment, he’s watching TV and eating some popcorn as the
phone rings.]
Ross: (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how’s the packing
going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over
at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt
there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,
it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, (Ohh, that’s the last time I’m ever gonna type
that line. It’s just so sad.) Joey is entering, angrily.]
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: What’s wrong?
Joey: Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500
to him in Cups!
Chandler: Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Joey: The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross
gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was
getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t
even get half a cup! Nothin’!!
Chandler: Oh man!!
Joey: And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think
beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.
Chandler: All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!
Joey: No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time!
In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too
you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want
you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a
great roommate.
Chandler: I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
Joey: It’s him, not it!
Chandler: No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your
nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
Joey: Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re
trying to give me money again!
Chandler: When did I try to give you money?
Joey: Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to
give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last
night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now
out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Chandler: I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that
you’re okay.
Joey: I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head
that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me
out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, (And that’s the last time for that line, no more
Chandler and Joey’s or Monica and Rachel’s, ever!) Joey and Ross are carrying
the last table of Rachel’s. Rachel follows slowly, but is stopped by Monica.]
Monica: Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: I’m really gonna miss you.
(They hug.)
Rachel: Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
Monica: Thanks.
Rachel: Yeah.
(Silence ensues.)
Rachel: Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours!
(They hug again.) 
Monica: Yeah.
Rachel: Bye house!
(They break the embrace.)
Rachel: Bye Mon.
Monica: Bye.
(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachel’s old and now empty room.)
Chandler: (entering) Hey.
Monica: She really left.
Chandler: I know. (He kisses her.)
Monica: Thank you.
Chandler: No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Monica: Can I ask you a question?
Chandler: Sure!
Monica: What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog
sitting in the living room.)
(And with that, an era ends as Chandler moves in with Monica as Rachel moves in with
Phoebe. It ‘tis a sad and happy time for Friends.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Ross’s apartment, Chandler is trying to get Joey’s money back from
Ross.]
Chandler: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Ross: And now you want that money back.
Chandler: Exactly.
Ross: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the
fake Ben.)
Chandler: It’s not a real game! I made it up!
Ross: I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Chandler: At a fake game!!
Ross: Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play
you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Chandler: Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Ross: No.
Chandler: Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards
and shrugs.)
EndMonica: (jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the
floor!
Chandler: I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Monica: Oh, So you can move them!
Chandler: Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for
you. 
[Joey enters with his new roommate who is played by none other than Elle MacPherson.]
Joey: Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my
new roommate!
Janine: Hi.
Ross: Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
Janine: Hi
Joey: Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Monica: It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Janine: Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
Joey: I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Chandler: So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Janine: Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Joey: (shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Ross: So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Janine: I'm a dancer.
Joey: You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Janine: Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Joey: Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door
behind her gasps ecstatically.)
Monica: Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Joey: Of course I did.
Monica: Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Joey: "When can you move in?"
Ross: Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Chandler: Unbelievable
Monica: Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Chandler: Hey, look at all the boxes!
Joey: Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Monica: Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate.
It-it'll be way too complicated. 
Ross: Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't
date her.
Chandler: All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with
that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped
into each other at the supermarket?
Joey: Oh God, yeah.
Chandler: Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Joey: (happily) Okay!
Chandler: No-no
Joey: Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Monica: Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such
close quarters, it could be trouble.
Joey: Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an
attractive woman and not flirt.
Monica: (chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Joey: You a little sad about that sweetheart?
[Scene, The Park: Phoebe and Rachel are getting ready to go running]
Phoebe: I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Rachel: Okay. (Runs off.)
Phoebe: Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far
apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)
[Scene, Central Perk: Rachel, Ross and Monica are there]
Rachel: You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between
Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Ross: Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every
night before she went to bed.
Rachel: Oh! I used to do that too!
Monica: Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Rachel: Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)
Monica: So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Rachel: Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just
don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Monica: Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
[Phoebe enters]
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Phoebe: Why? Why would you do that?
Monica: I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Rachel: Ankle.
Monica: We'll see.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s new apartment, Chandler is putting something away
under the sink.]
Chandler: OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around
and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess
Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the
giggling again)
Joey: (jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!
Chandler: (pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Joey: Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks
great!
Chandler: Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working
late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what
else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who
wouldn't wanna live with me?
Joey: (raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian
dancer.
Chandler: Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting
thing?
Joey: Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up
flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the
"Joey-love," look.) How you doin?
[Scene Joey and Janine’s new apartment, Janine is there. Joey walks in to see
Janine bent over, stretching.]
Joey: (voice cracking) Ohhhh man
Janine: Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Joey: No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need
to do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)
Janine: (touches his waist) Why don't you try to do-
Joey: (jumps up and yells) 
Janine: What's wrong?
Joey: Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all
sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes back
out quickly) Oh my God!
Janine: Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my
thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
(Joey laughs nervously and goes to his bedroom.)
[Scene, The Park, Rachel is running and Phoebe is hiding behind a tree.]
Phoebe: (jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab
your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Rachel: No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just
checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Phoebe: Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. (Runs off)
Rachel: No, wait Phoebe.
[Scene, Monica and Chandler’s, Chandler is there. Everything is out of its place
and Chandler's cleaning.]
Ross: (enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So,
Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?
Chandler: What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Ross: Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Chandler: Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Ross: Put it back exactly where you found it?
Chandler: Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found
it.
Ross: ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Chandler: She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Ross: Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Chandler: She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Ross: Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move
back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Chandler: I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Ross: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God,
she's going to sit on you.
Chandler: No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right
now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.
Monica: (on phone) Hi!
Chandler: Hey Mon, how's it going?
Monica: Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. 
Chandler: Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Monica: It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm
gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Chandler: No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Monica:  Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Chandler: It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.
Ross: Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture
frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s, continued from earlier.]
Chandler: We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the
easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got
it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
Ross: Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Chandler: What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the
carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on
the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's
what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of
the carpet.
Chandler: OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Ross: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the
seating area.
Chandler: Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match
the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Joey: (entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm
drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee
table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!?
(Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do
something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all
the time. 
Ross: Hey, I've been married 3 times
(Chandler gives him a round of mock applause.)
Joey: No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but
somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Ross: Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Chandler: Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we
went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not
stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Ross: Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either.
After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 
Chandler: Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.

Ross: Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Chandler: That's not specific to girls.
Joey: This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Ross: Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
Chandler: And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Ross: They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Chandler: Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Ross: (nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel’s, Rachel is there as Phoebe enters.]
Rachel: Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe: Sure 
Rachel: Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, I
just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not
have lied to you. 
Phoebe: So, what should you have done?
Rachel: Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Phoebe: Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Rachel: Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because
um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)
Phoebe: So?
Rachel: Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Phoebe: Why do you care?
Rachel: Because they're people.
Phoebe: But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Rachel: Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.
Phoebe: Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no,
okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay.
You're uptight.
Rachel: I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,
man.
Phoebe: That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me.
I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's
fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall
off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from
Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s, Chandler has the tape measure out and is busy
lining up the lamp on the kitchen counter, Ross is supervising the whole operation.]
Chandler: Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Ross: Who cares? I repel women.
[Monica tries to come in]
Chandler: (blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here!
R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Monica: What?!
Ross: (whispers) What?!
Chandler: (to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too
see me naked.
Ross: Why does anyone have to be naked?
Monica: Why is Ross naked?
Ross: I-I had to show Chandler something?
Monica: Naked?
Ross: Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Monica: Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Chandler: Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you
can come back later.
Monica: Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink
in the bathroom. Bye!
Chandler: Bye! Thank God
Ross: Dude, what'd you have?
Chandler: Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything
back into its original place.
Ross: (realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of
the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the
pictures.
Chandler: That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo
album)
Ross: So really, what'd ya have?
[Scene: Joey and Janine's, Janine's there. Joey enters]
Janine: Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Joey: Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Janine: Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Joey: Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Janine: Is there something wrong?
Joey: All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're
hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and
it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Janine: Joey...
Joey: No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and
you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Janine: Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're
really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Joey: Oh!
Janine: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate
and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine: I don't think so.
Joey: Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
Janine: I'm OK
Joey: What?!?!
Janine: What?
Joey: Oh dear God!
[Scene: The park, Rachel's running by herself and panting. After a little while she
decides to run like Phoebe.]
Rachel: (Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Phoebe: See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second
cause then you're gone!
Rachel: Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns
and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs
off.)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s, Chandler and Ross are there. Monica enters]
Monica: Is it okay for me to come in now?
Chandler: Uh-huh
Monica: Why is everything different?
Ross: Bye! (Runs out)
Chandler: No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room
got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)
Monica: Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get
me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Chandler: Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I
wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved
everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Monica: It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? 
Chandler: Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Monica: Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a
wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want
everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: Of course!
Chandler: Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Monica: All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves
on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Closing Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Janine and Chandler are there]
Ross: So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out
the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download
our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Janine: ...and live forever as a machine!
Ross: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right
now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Janine: Yeah, I gotta go.
Chandler: Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
EndChandler: Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was
wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control
of the galaxies last remaining energy source?

Chandler: So, is Janine around?

Joey: Uh, no, she’s at dance class.

Chandler: Can I check out what she did to my room?

Joey: Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really
mad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)

Chandler: (The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh
my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got
to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) It’s
spreading already.

Joey: (Looking around the room.) It is???

Chandler: (Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the
couch?

Joey: No.

Chandler: (Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little
box, that’s too small to put anything in?

Joey: No.

Chandler: No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you
let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.

Joey: (With Big Eyes.) All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.

Chandler: Yes talk to her. Be a man.

Joey: I’m a man.

Chandler: Defend yourself.

Joey: (Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)

Monica: Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

Chandler: Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different
situation.

Phoebe: Well that’s great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.)

Rachel: But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But,
just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and
she already doesn’t like me very much.

Chandler: That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.

Monica: I don’t think mine likes me either.

Ross: Maybe it’s a universal thing?

Joey: Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a
Wednesday. (Everybody gets up.)

Chandler: Yeah let’s head off to work.

Monica: We should go.
[Scene: Rachel’s office, Phoebe hands Rachel a key card.]

little nicer.

Joey: Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the
foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.

Janine: Well I just thought…

was the best gossip she’d heard all year.

Chandler: I am proud of all my friends today.

Rachel: Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy
guy.

Phoebe: What?

Rachel: Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If

Rachel: To get you to make out with him!!!

Phoebe: Ohhh.

Monica: (Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth
look less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue,
yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.

Ross: I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an
hour.

Monica: Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so
bright.

Ross: Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.

Monica: I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.

Ross: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.

Monica: Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.

Ross: But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?

Monica: Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.

Ross: What??

Monica: All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.

Ross: No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)

Phoebe: Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He
smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
[Scene: Chandler’s and Monica’s apartment, Chandler and Monica are sitting at
the kitchen table making potpourri sachets.]

Monica: Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.

Chandler: Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m
going to go over to Joey’s.

Monica: Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.

Chandler: Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine
side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a
lesbian couple.

Monica: You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right,
I’m sorry.

Chandler: Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You
know, do kind of like a man thing.

Monica: Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer
and hammer up some drywall.

Chandler: You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and
hammer up drywall?

Monica: When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear.
(Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know
why I said that.
[Scene: Joey and Janine’s apartment, Chandler walks in. Joey and Janine are
knitting at the kitchen counter.]

Joey: Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.

Chandler: No thanks, Josephine.
[Scene: Ross’s apartment, Chandler enters. Ross is putting on makeup.]

Chandler: Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are
all the men???
[Scene: Elevator at the Ralph Lauren offices, Kim’s waiting for it. The door opens
and Rachel is inside.]

Rachel: Ohh, hi, Kim.

Kim: Hi Rachel.

Rachel: Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it
didn’t happen.

Kim: You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?

Rachel: Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made
out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.

Kim: That’s not true?

Rachel: No.

Kim: Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to
access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.

Rachel: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.

Kim: Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You
are sadly mistaken.

Rachel: I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I
did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I
don’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)

Kim: Hi Ralph.

Ralph Lauren:: Hi Kim. (Dead silence until Ralph gets off the elevator.)

Kim: Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
[Scene: Hillary’s apartmen,. Hillary and Ross are having dinner. He is avoiding
opening his mouth.]

Hillary: And after that, what could I do except become a chef.

Ross: Mmm-Hmm.

Hillary: And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.

Ross: Mmm.

Hillary: You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with,
they just talk and talk.

Ross: Mm-Hmm.

Hillary: After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?

Ross: (Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.

Hillary: I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you
a little bit?

Ross: Mmm-Unmm.

Hillary: Come on. I want to know.

Ross: Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am from
Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my
spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.
[Scene: Joey and Janine’s apartment, Joey and Monica are arranging flowers.
Chandler walks in.]

Joey: So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a
frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.

Monica: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.

Chandler: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with
the flowers.

Monica: Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to
make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.

Joey: Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)

Chandler: What is the matter with you ?!?

Joey: What?

Chandler: You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You
got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is
not Joey!!

Joey: Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know,
they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a
famous baby.

Chandler: You’re turning into a women.

Joey: No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.

Chandler: Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?

Joey: It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God,
I’m a women!!!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there.]

Rachel: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.

Phoebe: But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.

Rachel: I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

Phoebe: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You
know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she
ever think of that?

Rachel: You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?

Phoebe: Just for a second.

Rachel: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?

Phoebe: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

Rachel: I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I
wouldn’t.

Phoebe: Ohh, sleep with Kenny.

Rachel: That wouldn’t help me.

Phoebe: Ohh, yes it would.
[Scene: Hillary’s apartment, Hillary and Ross are finishing up their date.]

Hillary: I’ve had a really good time tonight.

Ross: Mmm.

Hillary: You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.

Ross: (Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.)
Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)

Hillary: Are you going to eat that bread?

Ross: (Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing
it.) Mmmm.

Hillary: (Laughing) You make me laugh.

Ross: Hmm-Hmm.

Hillary: Would you like to move over to the couch?

Ross: Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)

Hillary: Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.

Ross: (Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.

Hillary: Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She has
some black light posters on the wall.)

Ross: (Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?
(They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So,
ahh, where were we?

Hillary: Are those your teeth??

Ross: Ohh, you can see them, huh?

Hillary: Yes. They’re insanely white.

Ross: I-I, did that for you.

Hillary: What’s a matter with you?

Ross: What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!
[Scene: Elevator at the Ralph Lauren Offices, Rachel gets in . Kim is there.]

Rachel: Kim, hi.

Kim: Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph
Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.

Rachel: Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were
right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.

Kim: Oh, really?

Rachel: (Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t do
this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this.
I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said,
"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in
the Ralph Lauren machine."

Kim: You expect me to believe..(Doors open, Ralph steps in.) Hi Ralph.

Ralph Lauren:: Hi Kim. (Dead silence again until he gets off.)

Kim: Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like
he hates you. Then it is true.

Rachel: Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.

Kim: Ohh honey come here. (Hugging Rachel.) Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been
there.

Rachel: You and Ralph?

Kim: Kenny the copyboy.

[Scene: Joey and Janine’s apartment, Joey paces the floor waiting for Janine. She
walks in.]

Janine: Hey.

Joey: Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.

Janine: What’s the matter? Are you upset?

Joey: I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in
here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?
That’s just the way it has to be.

Janine: Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.

Joey: Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I
didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the
girlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if
you want to.

Janine: Okay.

Joey: And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.

Janine: Sure.

Joey: And a couple of these little tiny boxes.

Janine: Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?

Joey: (Smiling) Okay.

EndRachel: You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s
outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in
handy
Monica: Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?
Rachel: (thinks) I don’t know.
Monica: Me neither.
Phoebe: Rachel.
Monica: What?!
Phoebe: I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither.
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Ross are sitting on the couch.]
Joey: You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Chandler: Yeah.
Ross: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Chandler: So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Joey: Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but
I’m not even sure I got it.
Ross: What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
(He and Chandler crack up.)
Chandler: And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
(He and Ross crack up again. Joey just sits there)
Chandler: (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Ross: Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why
he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Chandler: So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Ross: Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show
the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Chandler: Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Ross: Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Chandler: Yeah!
Ross: Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
Chandler: Okay (he goes to sit down).
(Ross leaps out of his chair and runs out the door, with Chandler in hot pursuit.)
Gunther: (handing Joey the bill) Here you go.
Joey: Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not
working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.
Gunther: Well, if you want, you can work here.
Joey: Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a
soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to
wait on all my friends.
Gunther: Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as
much as you want.
Joey: What?!
Gunther: Flexible hours.
Joey: Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s bedroom, they are in bed together.]
Monica: (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,
but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Chandler: (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it. 
Monica: It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Chandler: You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross
did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know?
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Monica: That’s a good idea. 
Chandler: Yeah!
Monica: Do you know what’s a bad idea?
Chandler: Picking Rachel.
Monica: That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear
something?
Chandler: Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing
my thoughts.
Monica: It’s coming from the living room.
(They go out to investigate, and find Joey wrapped in a blanket watching their
television.)
Joey: (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back
to bed.)
[Scene, Phoebe and Rachel’s, they’re sitting together on the couch.]
Monica: (entering) Hey, you guys.

Phoebe and Rachel: Hey.
Monica: (laughing) Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make
such a cute couple.
Rachel: Monica, what are you doing?
Monica: (laughing harder) Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate
some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you
picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Phoebe: I guess it was kinda funny.
Monica: (angrily) It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that?
Why didn’t you pick me?
Phoebe: Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than
you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay
let’s go to lunch!
Monica: That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay,
prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!
Phoebe: No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just
not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s
all.
Rachel: (To Monica) Well, people are different.
Phoebe: Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want.
Y’know, you can just walk all over her.
Rachel: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover?
I’m not a pushover.
Phoebe: Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover.
Rachel: Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you
know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think
that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to
lunch. (She leaves)
Monica: (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her
coat and leaves, too.)
[Cut to the hallway.]
Rachel: I cannot believe her.
Monica: I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Rachel: Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Monica: I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.
Rachel: All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Monica: All right.
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are there as Ross enters and sees
Gunther.]
Ross: (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this
out.
(Gunther looks at the joke and laughs.)
Gunther: Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up. 
(Ross begins to say something, realizes what Gunther just said, turns, and glares at
Chandler. Chandler just shrugs it off.)
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading
up there.
Ross: Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Joey: Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there. 
Rachel: No.
Monica: No, thank you.
Joey: (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m
heading up there. 
Woman: I’d love an ice water.
Joey: You got it.
Monica: Joey, what are you doing?
Joey: Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong with
you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
Rachel: Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
Joey: Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re in
on a secret together.)
Gunther: Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.
Joey: Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on
aprons. 
Monica: Joey, do you work here?
Joey: No.
Customer: Hey, waiter.
Joey: Yeah?
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]
Monica: Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?
Joey: It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and
now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.
Chandler: So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
Joey: I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess
I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I
just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Rachel: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Ross: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Joey: Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.
Ross: Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.
Joey: See, now it’s weird again.
Chandler: I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make
a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs,
then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15,
coffeehouse.
Rachel: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass
on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the
coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long
way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey: Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how
about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.
Ross: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Joey: Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I
made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.
(He looks at Rachel and winks, she gives him the thumbs-up sign.)
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel’s, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Rachel and Monica
enter.]
Rachel: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Phoebe: Okay.
Monica: So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little
bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Rachel: Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Monica: Hah!
Phoebe: That true, I am flaky.
Rachel: So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?
Phoebe: Yeah, totally.
Monica: Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.
Rachel: Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Phoebe: That’s great. Good for you guys.
Monica: I am not high maintenance!
Rachel: I am not a pushover!
Phoebe: Who said you were?

Monica and Rachel: You did!
Phoebe: Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is coming back from using the phone.]
Joey: Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Gunther: No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.
Joey: Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part.
Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this
bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’
Gunther: That’s the whole part?

Joey: Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …
Gunther: Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.
Joey: Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is
taken.’
Patron: Oh, excuse me.
Joey: No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Patron: I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
Joey: So, you’d hire me, right?
Patron: For what?
Joey: Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be
closed for about an hour. 
Customers: Huh? What?
Joey: Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very
important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Ross are both pouting and sitting on the
couch.]
Ross: It’s my joke.
Chandler: It’s my joke.

Ross and Chandler: It’s my joke.
Ross: Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.
Chandler: Let’s have Monica decide.
Ross: Yeah!
Chandler: Yeah!
Ross: Hey Mon.
Chandler: Mon, get out here!
Ross: Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
Chandler: Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Monica: Why do I have to decide?
Chandler: Because you’re the only one that can be fair.
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.
Ross: Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most
important thing in the world.
Chandler: (to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m
your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.
Ross: We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide
which one of us is telling the truth—me. 
Monica: Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Chandler: Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Monica: Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Chandler: Can I finish my story?!
Monica: Do you want me to pick you?!
Ross: See, I would never snap at you like that.
(Chandler motions to Monica that he’ll give her two babies.)
Monica: Continue.
Chandler: So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s
doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how
the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his
point.)
Ross: Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?
Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!
Chandler: I’m not arguing with that.
Monica: All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.
(Both Chandler and Ross are eager to hear her decision.) 
Monica: You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to
women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you
should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
Now let it go! The joke sucks! 
(Monica leaves the room)
Ross: It’s your joke.
Chandler: Is not.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at a table and Phoebe is on the couch. Chandler
and Monica can be seen outside, she’s lecturing him, and pushes him inside. He then
nods to Rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then Monica
makes a grand enterance.]
Monica: Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Chandler: Hi, oh hi.
Monica: Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what
you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
(Rachel and Phoebe exchange looks.)
Chandler: (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be
perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and
Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.
Rachel: Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever
heard.
Phoebe: Really? I’ve heard better.
Monica: Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Chandler: (To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing
again?
Monica: Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Chandler: (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little
high maintenance.
Monica: Ahhh! You are on my list.
Chandler: I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re
passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think
that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good
too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I
like … maintaining you.
Monica: (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to say
that. (They hug). All right you’re off my list. 
Chandler: (happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.) 
Monica: (sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to
be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Phoebe: (to Monica) Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
(Joey enters.)
Chandler: Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?
Joey: Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so
…
Phoebe: Wow! That is a bad audition.
Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?
Joey: Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in
charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Rachel: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left
you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s
not right.
Joey: Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Rachel: Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m
not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I
really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the
counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you
have to fire him…
Gunther: Okay.
Rachel: What?
Gunther: He can have his job back.
Rachel: That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that
all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Joey: That’s great. Thanks Rach.
Rachel: Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?
Phoebe: (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat.
Rachel: Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)

table, talking.]

Chandler: Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering
that.

right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are
terrible!
Phoebe: Sorry Jill.
Ross: Sorry-sorry Jill.
Rachel: What’d you get?
Phoebe: Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I
got uh, this y’know "I want a job sweater." (Holds up the same sweater.)
Rachel: Oh.
Phoebe: And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Rachel: Apartment pants?
Phoebe: Yeah, you never heard of them?
Rachel: No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you
get?
Ross: Huh? Oh, I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!
Rachel: A pajmena?
Ross: Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Rachel: Really?
Ross: Ross, wants a pajmena?
Ross: It’s a rug. (Jill winces.)
Rachel: Jill?
Jill: (covers her eyes and starts crying) I’m sorry Rachel, I’m
sorry…
Rachel: Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Jill: Right! But, I am sorry.
Rachel: All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t
let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should
take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.)
And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away,
‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m
gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of
Jill’s stuff.)
Jill: She took all my stuff.
Ross: Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)
Jill: (gasps) That’s the best one! Oh my God, (hugs him) thank you so much!
Ross: Well. Hey…
Jill: Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Ross: Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I’m
sorry!"
Jill: (hits him) Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
Phoebe: What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment
pants, how dumb was I?
(They both look at her.)
Jill: Were you this cute in high school?
Ross: Oh stop.
Jill: No you stop!
Ross: No, you stop!
Jill: You stop!
Phoebe: (gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and
you’ll both stop it!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still very sick and is entering the living
room from the bathroom wearing a robe. Chandler is reading a magazine.]
Monica: Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something
crazy!
Chandler: I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of
orange juice.)
Monica: Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then
you’re coming with me.
Chandler: That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy
here. (Points to his nose.)
Monica: (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with
this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with the
big robe.)
Chandler: Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.
Monica: (in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)
Chandler: Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just
can’t have sex with a sick person.
Monica: I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick
person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We
are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Chandler: That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of
mwha-ah-libe.
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is putting away her new clothes as Phoebe enters.]
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey.
Rachel: What’s up?!
Phoebe: Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.
Rachel: Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just
pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Phoebe: No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you
left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you
that there might be something there.
Rachel: With Ross and Jill?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: With Ross and my sister?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: Oh there is no way.
Phoebe: Okay then.
Rachel: Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it
when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?!
Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this
is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I
don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that
she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister,
this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to
me.
Phoebe: But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is giving the bill to the same beautiful woman from before.]
Joey: That’ll be $3.85.
Woman: What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
Joey: It’s just I can’t because my manager said I… (Gets an idea)
(Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear
Annie…
Woman: Amy!
Joey: (still singing) "…Amy! Happy birthday to you!"

A Male Customer: Hey, that’s weird, today’s my birthday too!
Joey: Yeah, not it here it isn’t.
Jill: (entering) Sorry I’m late, what’s up?
Rachel: (on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.
Jill: Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn’t go in. How
strong am I?
Rachel: That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross.
He works at the university. 
Jill: Yeah.
Rachel: Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so
you think you’re gonna go out?
Jill: Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Rachel: I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you
guys.
Jill: No! I mean he’s nice.
Rachel: Yeah.
Jill: He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know? But
he’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy you’d date
because you did. Me, not so much.
Rachel: Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there
something wrong with Ross?
Jill: Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little
bookish.
Rachel: Are-are you saying he’s a geek?
Jill: You think so too?
Rachel: No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Jill: Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type.
Rachel: What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those
things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Jill: Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out.
Rachel: Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.
Jill: No! Y’know what Rachel? You’re right, y’know he has been
really nice to me.
Rachel: Yeah but, he’s not your type.
Jill: Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. Y’know I’m doing all
these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Rachel: Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to
much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that
tried to much too fast don’t you?
Jill: What?
Rachel: She-she died Jill.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler has fallen asleep reading a book. Monica calls
from the bedroom and wakes him up.]
Monica: (still sick) Chandler!
Chandler: Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from
the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively
on the bed. Or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the
robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!
Monica: (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Chandler: Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Monica: How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Chandler: I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no!
No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy.
And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Monica: Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I
wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.) 
Chandler: Would you please get some rest!
Monica: I’m fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing
fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is singing Happy Birthday to yet another good-looking woman.
Gunther is watching and is not very happy.]
Joey: (singing) "Happy birthday to you!"
Gunther: You’re paying for that.
Joey: What? No-no it’s her birthday!
Gunther: You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
Joey: But it really…
Gunther: You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Joey: Damnit! (Storms off.)
Ross: (entering) Rach? Hi!
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Rachel: Well yeah…
Ross: Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would
never have thought of going out with her, never!
Rachel: Really?!
Ross: Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Rachel: Oh so-so not really never.
Ross: I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all
we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Joey: (overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still sick and is hobbling out into the living
room for some help from Chandler who’s on the couch reading.]
Monica: (entering) Chandler, I think I’m sick.
Chandler: Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Monica: Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my
chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Monica: Come on! I really need your help!
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no!
Monica: Fine, I’ll rub it on myself.
Chandler: Okay.
(To start this task, she lowers the top of her robe to reveal that she is naked from
the waist up, well at least her back is, and starts to rub on the gunk. Chandler notices
this, and has something start happening. I’ll let you fill in the blank here.)
Chandler: So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Monica: Yeah?
Chandler: It’s nice.
Monica: Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Chandler: Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
Monica: I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Chandler: It’s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you
wanna go uh, mix it up?
Monica: Not now, I’m sick!
Chandler: Oh come on you big faker!
Monica: What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Chandler: Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Monica: Okay, if you really wanna have sex…
Chandler: Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Monica: Worked like a charm.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is there as Jill enters to start her date with Ross.]
Jill: (entering) Hi!
Rachel: Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Jill: This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
(She spins to show Rachel the outfit she’s wearing.)
Rachel: Well, I-I don’t like it.
Jill: Really?!
Rachel: It’s kinda slutty.
Jill: It’s yours!
Rachel: Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.
Jill: (laughs) Me too.
Ross: (entering) Hi Jill!
Jill: Hey!
Ross: Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
Rachel: Rachel.
Ross: Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home,
you’re-you’re-you’re right here.
Rachel: Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!
(There’s an awkward silence.)
Ross: Okay. So well I’ll umm, (To Rachel) I’ll have her home by
midnight.
(Rachel laughs a little too hard as Ross and Jill leave for their date. After they have
left, Rachel starts to break down.)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel enters and walks quickly over to the window to
watch Ross’s apartment. We see that Ross’s apartment is empty.]
Rachel: Why aren’t you home yet?!
Monica: (calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?
Rachel: Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!
Chandler: (calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
Rachel: Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the
view. What are you guys doing?
Chandler: We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
(We see that Ross is returning to his apartment with Jill.)
Rachel: (gasps) Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Monica: (entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross’s
apartment) Is that your sister?
Rachel: Ugh, she is a slut!
Monica: God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Rachel: Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!
Chandler: He’s taking off her coat!
(We see that Ross is taking off Jill’s coat.)
Rachel: Oh, this is just terrible. 
Monica: Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure
that nothing is gonna…(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)
Rachel: Oh. (Squeaks again.)
Chandler: Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare
from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes
there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well,
I’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)
To Be Continued
Ending Credits
(There is no credits scene, just a preview of the next couple of episodes.)
EndMonica: It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean,
y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger,
all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.
Y’know, give him my flower.
Rachel: Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!!
Monica: Y’know what? You are right?!
Rachel: Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be
all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever
they want, whenever…
Monica: Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on
your husband!
Rachel: Oh what do you know? Virgin!
[Scene: The hospital, Ross and Monica are in Phoebe’s room. Phoebe is in the
bathroom and Monica notices smoke coming out from underneath the door.]
Monica: Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Phoebe: Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects. 
Monica: Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Phoebe: No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Monica: Put it out!!
Phoebe: Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I’m so
glad you’re here.
Ross: Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
Phoebe: Oh, give it to me.
Ross: I got it!
Phoebe: Give it!
(He does a kara-tay move to silence her, then answers the phone.)
Ross: (on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she can’t come to the phone right
now. (Listens.) Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
Phoebe: Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Ross: J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you
were getting better.
Phoebe: Thank God.
Ross: (To Monica) Yeah, she’s fired.
[Scene: Rachel and Barry’s bedroom, Rachel is watching Days of Our Lives.
Of course it’s a Dr. Drake Remoray scene. It’s set in a hospital room, and Dr.
Wesley and a nurse are talking about a female patient with a bandage around her head.]
Nurse: You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let
her go.
Dr. Wesley: Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady. 
(He goes to turn off a machine. Suddenly, Dr. Drake Remoray appears at the door with
two cops!)
Dr. Drake Remoray: Not so fast Wesley! (Rachel does a silent clap.)
Dr. Wesley: (with evil dripping off his tongue) Remoray!
Dr. Drake Remoray: That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that,
you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!
Rachel: (very relived) Oh! Thank God!
[Cut back to the TV, the cops are leading Dr. Wesley out, and as they pass Remoray and
Wesley exchange evil glances.]
Dr. Drake Remoray: Hope! Hope!
Hope: (sleepily) Drake!
Dr. Drake Remoray: You’re not dying Hope, you’re gonna live a long,
healthy life. With me.
Hope: Oh Drake.
[Drake and Hope kiss.]
Rachel: Okay! (She picks up the phone, Joey’s phone number, and starts to
dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi, Joey! It’s Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow
night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Commercial Break
{Transcriber’s Note: This is where Part II begins, which means this is now episode
616.}
[Scene: Ross and Carol's, Carol is working on something at the table and Ross is
reading a newspaper on the couch.]
Ross: So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna
start to find…
Carol: Ooh, actually I’ve been making a list of all the women I know who
might be into doing this!
Ross: Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to
another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone’s
been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
Carol: Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so…
Ross: Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me
kinda…
Carol: Oh, me too.
Ross: Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep.

Ross: Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
[Scene: The hospital, Chandler and Monica are there with Phoebe as Ross enters.]
Ross: Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey.
Ross: Hey, how’s it going?
Phoebe: Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here.
Crazy!
Monica: (handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.
Phoebe: What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Monica: But, I put some honey in it.
(Phoebe mocks what Monica just said. Ross pulls Chandler aside.)
Ross: She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?
Chandler: No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Phoebe: What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Chandler: (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you
should start think about getting a different job.
Phoebe: Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
(Points at Ross.)
Chandler: Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart
attacks at 31.
Phoebe: I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?
Monica: Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Phoebe: Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Chandler: Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a
heart attack.
Phoebe: Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked
people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
[Scene: Joey's apartment, (The one he had when he was Dr. Drake Remoray, because he
still is.) Rachel is there and admiring the big ceramic fake dog.]
Rachel: Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!
Joey: I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on
polls. You’ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.
Rachel: Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)
Joey: (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?
Rachel: Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making her
refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s
raining!
Joey: Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there
and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.
Rachel: Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Joey: It’s uh, right through there. (Points.)
Rachel: Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know, if someone told me a week ago
that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…
Joey: Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?
Rachel: Yeah, it sure is!
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is pouring wine for her boyfriend, Dr. Roger.]
Monica: I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And
y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?
Dr. Roger: They have parasites?
Monica: No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac. 
Dr. Roger: What people?
Monica: People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)
Dr. Roger: So oysters, huh?
Monica: And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous.
Something we can eat, with our hands.
Dr. Roger: Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicable
diseases…
Monica: No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!
Dr. Roger: Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay! 
Monica: Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!
Dr. Roger: I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great,
maybe save me some?
Monica: I can’t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)
[Scene: Ross and Carol's, Ross and Carol are waiting anxiously for their new partner to
arrive.]
Ross: We’re really gonna do this, huh?
Carol: Looks like it.
Ross: Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out
at… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
Carol: (jumping up to get it) I got it!
Ross: Okay.
Carol: (opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Who’d you think it was gonna be?)
Susan: Hey! (They hug.)
Carol: Thank you so much for coming.
Susan: Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world.
(They start moving towards the bedroom, never taking their eyes off each other. They
move past Ross and stop.)
Ross: I’m-I’m Ross by the way.
Susan: (not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands
it to him.) I love what you’ve done with this space.
Carol: Thank you so much.
(They disappear into the bedroom leaving Ross standing in the living room holding
Susan’s coat.)
Ross: How hot is this?!
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are eating Monica’s dinner.]
Chandler: I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.
Monica: Yeah, me too.
Chandler: Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.)
"Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second
cous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)
Monica: Stop it!! That’s not funny!!
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be
y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Chandler: What was tonight?
Monica: You don’t want to know what tonight was.
Chandler: Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
Monica: Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.
Chandler: With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica
shrugs.) Oh my God!
Monica: All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!
Chandler: Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!
Monica: How many?
Chandler: Nine.
Monica: I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Chandler: Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect
guy?
Monica: No. He’s not a horrible guy.
Chandler: Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.
Monica: Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!
Chandler: No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen
for you.
Monica: Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Chandler: Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
Monica: I was kidding.
Chandler: So was I.
[Scene: Joey's apartment, Rachel is now three sheets to the wind and Joey is watching
her.]
Rachel: Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know
where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Joey: Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I
pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Rachel: Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! I
just fell right off the couch there.
Joey: Yeah you did.
Rachel: Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.) 
Joey: Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Rachel: Yeah?
Joey: When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Rachel: Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.
Joey: Come, come here. 
(He takes her hands in his and kisses each one, then kisses her on the lips. When the
break the kiss, Rachel starts to get nauseous and throw up. Joey backs away in horror.)
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, continued from earlier. Monica and Chandler are still
discussing the previous question.]
Chandler: We can’t do this.
Monica: No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?
Chandler: Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of
pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I
wouldn’t want to disappoint you.
Monica: Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re
horrible, how would I know?
Chandler: I do like that.
Monica: It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Chandler: Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for
tonight, right?
Monica: Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out
another friend. (Points at herself.)
Chandler: Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!
Monica: Noo!! Okay!!
Chandler: Okay! (They both get up.)
Monica: Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Chandler: I have some moves.
Monica: I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs
away.) Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! (Giggles.) Oh y’know what? I’m sorry,
this is just too weird.
Chandler: Yeah, let’s just forget it.
Monica: What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)
Chandler: Okay!
(She turns out the lights and in the darkened room Chandler starts to moan.)
Chandler: Oh yeah.
Monica: Chandler?
Chandler: (sexily) Yeah?
Monica: That’s the couch.
Commercial Break

up!
Joey: Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Rachel: Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…
Joey: No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Rachel: God I’m just a horrible person.
Joey: Wh-why?
Rachel: Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I
came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Joey: That’s ridiculous! I’m not a "Star," just a regular
famous actor.
Rachel: Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.
Joey: Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show
when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…
Rachel: The ring from the cave, yeah.
Joey: Wow! Uh okay, well uh… (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the
ring.)
Rachel: (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Joey: Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want!
And I want you to have it.
Rachel: No! No-no-no…
Joey: Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you
are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you
didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.
Rachel: But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her
brother.
Joey: Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Rachel: Yeah!
[Scene: Phoebe’s hospital room, Joey and Ross enter as Phoebe comes out of the
bathroom wearing her robe.]
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Look at you! You’re up!
Joey: All right!
Phoebe: I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water?
I’ll be back soon.
Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are
ya?
Phoebe: No. I’ve learned my lesson.
(She goes out into the hall and when she’s there and the door is closed; she rips
off her robe to reveal her work clothes.)
Phoebe: Let’s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old
man who’s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.)
Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)
[Cut back to her room, Joey and Ross are sitting there waiting for her.]
Ross: Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?
Joey: (not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think
Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I….
Ross: No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.
Joey: You?
Ross: Yeah!
Joey: Wow!
Ross: Yeah!
Joey: All right! So, was it amazing?
Ross: It was, it was okay.
Joey: Just okay—Did you do it right?!
Ross: Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think,
"Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?"
Joey: Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much
better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?
Ross: Oh-oh, absolutely!
(They both laugh.)
Ross: It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and
then there was a lot of waiting around.
Joey: But you got to be with both of them, right?
Ross: Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Joey: Not the other one?
Ross: No, she kept kicking me away!
Joey: Yeah, you don’t want that.
Ross: No!
Joey: Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Ross: Oh I a lot of stuff!
Joey: You got a little bored?
Ross: A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Joey: Yeah? What did ya have?
Ross: Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard…
Joey: Sounds good.
Ross: It really was!
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is making a sandwich as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait
a minute that was you!
Monica: Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!
Chandler: So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Monica: Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Chandler: Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh,
he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when… (He fakes falling asleep.)
Monica: Are you okay?
Chandler: Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Monica: Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I
was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, "Can the
doctor see me now?"
Chandler: I bet he can.
Monica: Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a
physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure you’re okay?
Chandler: Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine! (Does a
kara-tay move.)
[Scene: Rachel and Barry’s bedroom, Rachel is returning from her disastrous
attempt at an affair to find that Barry was much, much more successful with his.]
Rachel: Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Barry: You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Rachel: Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
[Scene: Phoebe’s office, she is arriving without the knowledge that she’s
been fired.]
Phoebe: Surprise! Look who’s back!

Arthur: Hey Pheebs! 
Phoebe: Hey! 

Arthur: (To another coworker) Call security. (To Phoebe) Pheebs, didn’t
you get fired?
Phoebe: Uh, I don’t think so!
Jack: Phoebe?
Phoebe: Jack!! Hey!
Jack: What are you doing here?
Phoebe: All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was
fired. He should do his research, huh?
Jack: Well, you were fired.
Phoebe: Nu-uh!
Jack: I told that guy who answered your phone.
Phoebe: Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t
count—Anyway, I’ll be in my office.
Jack: Uh, Phoebe you-you don’t have an office.
Phoebe: That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this
plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
Jack: (approaches her) Phoebe, listen…
Phoebe: You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this
company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little
mistake…
Jack: You lost 13 million dollars.
Phoebe: Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough
that—Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Jack: Are you all right?
Phoebe: I’m having another heart attack!
Jack: What?!
Phoebe: I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Jack: Take it easy. (Sits her down.)
Phoebe: (to Arthur, he’s the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!
Woman: Hey Pheebs! How’s it going?!
Phoebe: Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.
Woman: Wow! Well, welcome back!
Phoebe: Yeah.
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is there as Rachel storms in.]
Rachel: Hi Ross!
Ross: Hey Rachel.
Rachel: Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Ross: Umm, no.
Rachel: Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for
him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Ross: That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?
Rachel: Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But, you know
who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Sit down! 
Ross: Okay. (He does so.) 
Rachel: Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of
town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!
Ross: We’re sorry.
Rachel: No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of
marriage?
Ross: Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
Rachel: Aw what are you?! A detective?
Ross: Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband
and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Rachel: Oh. (Doesn’t believe it.)
Ross: Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their
marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives
engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she
barely knows from the gym!
Rachel: Who are these men?
Ross: Men. I guy I know.
Rachel: Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers)
gay.
Ross: She is not… (Realizes) She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so
gay! I can’t believe this.
Rachel: Good day for married people huh?
Ross: I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
Rachel: I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great
either.
Ross: Try telling my wife that.
[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is blowing out a candle as Chandler enters.]
Chandler: (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
Monica: Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Chandler: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Monica: What?!
Chandler: I’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.) 
Monica: Why would you do that?
Chandler: Because you shouldn’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with
me.
Monica: Really?
Chandler: Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look,
things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or
with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I
couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know
with a friend.
Monica: Chandler!
Chandler: I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know
because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I
guess I’m not technically a "doctor…"
(Monica runs over and kisses him.)
Monica: There was just one woman, wasn’t there?
Chandler: No, there were two.
Monica: Including me?
Chandler: Oh yeah.
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is singing a new song as the gang looks on.]
Phoebe: (singing)


It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see…
    One of them won’t do it, but the second one will set you free…
    Tell all your hate and anger, it’s time to say good-bye…
    And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!
    La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la……



End(Ross screams like a little girl.)
Rachel: Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s bedroom, he’s still trying to figure out what
to make Monica.]
Chandler: Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,
and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then
he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws
it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a
pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he
just removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down and
continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A
mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)
[Cut to the living room, Chandler is entering as Monica finishes wrapping her present
for him on the kitchen table.]
Chandler: Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Monica: Sure! Okay, you go first.
Chandler: Okay, come here! Come here.
Monica: Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the
couch.)
Chandler: Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Monica: Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Chandler: (momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
Monica: Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Chandler: Okay!
Monica: Okay, you ready to open yours?
Chandler: Yeah!
Monica: Okay.
(He opens his present to find Phoebe’s sock bunny from earlier.)
Chandler: It’s a sock bunny.
Monica: Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Chandler: Not really.
Monica: Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See
that’s what this is about.
Chandler: I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Monica: No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s
uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I
didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that
we’re supposed to make the presents!
Chandler: Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…
Monica: No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just…
You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for
me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am
going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do
anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
Chandler: (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They
both run into the bedroom.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s bedroom, they are relaxing in sexual bliss.]
Chandler: Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to
young to have seen that!
Monica: Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y’know, your birthday is in a
month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Chandler: You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Monica: We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)
Chandler: Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
Monica: Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was
too expensive?
Chandler: You have done enough!
Monica: I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Chandler: No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.
(The oven dings.)
Monica: Oop, your cake is ready!
Chandler: Oop!
(They both get out of bed and go get some cake.)
Chandler: Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
(As they approach the kitchen, the door opens and in walks in a Joey look-a-like.)
Joey's Look-A-Like: Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Just
gettin’ a soda! (Does so.)
Monica: Who the hell are you?!
Joey's Look-A-Like: I’m Joey! How are you doin’?!
Joey: (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you
doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)
Joey: Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Chandler: Who the hell is Carl?!
Joey: Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a
medical research project.
Chandler: Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,
aren’t they?
Joey: Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The
only problem is, Carl’s acting is… (Does the international hand symbol for
so-so.)
Monica: The only problem!
Joey: Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid
commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed
it up.
Carl: (sticking his head back in) Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Joey: (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are returning.]
Phoebe: Pat Sajak?
Rachel: Yep!
Phoebe: Alex Trebek?
Rachel: Oh, of course!
Phoebe: Chuck Woolery?
Rachel: Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host,
who’s ass I cannot kick.
(They start to walk into the living room and notice someone’s head sticking up
from behind a chair. The camera cuts to the other side and we see it’s Ross.)
[Time lapse. The girls have Ross pinned face down. Phoebe is sitting on his back and
arms while holding his head down and facing Rachel. Rachel is sitting on his knees and
holding his lower legs vertically, causing Ross pain.]
Rachel: Say it!
Phoebe: Say we are unagi!
Ross: It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
Rachel: Say it!
Ross: Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you
can get very, very hurt!
(Rachel yanks on his legs again and he groans in pain.)
[Scene: The Medical Research office, Joey is there with Carl in the waiting room. Two
identical twins come out and both wave by at the same time.]
Joey: All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Carl: Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Joey: That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?
Carl: Well, I’m not gonna talk because…
Joey: (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey
silences him with a grunt.)
The Doctor: (entering) (To the receptionist) Can I have the next one please?
(Takes the form.) Joey and Tony Tribbiani. (Joey and Carl stand up.)
Joey: That’s us.
The Doctor: (seeing they’re not identical) But uh, this is a study for
identical twins.
Joey: That’s right, $2,000.
The Doctor: But, you’re not identical twins.
Joey: Damnit Carl!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is getting ready for Chandler’s arrival. He
enters and finds the place lit with candles and dinner on the table.]
Chandler: Oh my good God.
Monica: Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3,
macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Chandler: Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Monica: I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to
that tape you made me.
Chandler: Oh, the mixed tape.
(Monica pushes play and The Way You Look Tonight starts to play.)
Monica: The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
(He hesitates, then goes over to dance with her.)
Monica: You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)
(Suddenly, a strange and familiar voice comes out of the tape player. Here’s a
hint, OH…MY…GAWD!! That’s right, it’s Janice!)

Janice: I love the way you look every night Chandler! (Monica breaks the
kiss and Chandler freezes in terror.) That’s why I made you this tape! Happy
Birthday! Love Janice!
Chandler: No! You’re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs
away with a look that could kill on her face.)
[Scene: A women’s self-defense class, the instructor is just finishing a class.]
The Instructor: Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s
remember, let’s be safe out there. 
(The women all clap and start to leave as Ross comes up to the instructor. Apparently
he was hiding in the back.)
Ross: It’s a great class.
The Instructor: Thanks.
Ross: Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the
woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
The Instructor: Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them…
Ross: No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
The Instructor: Who? Me the attacker?
Ross: Yes that’s right.
The Instructor: Why?
Ross: I tired attacking two women, did not work.
The Instructor: What?!
Ross: No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
The Instructor: Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Ross: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m
here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is trying to explain himself to Monica.]
Chandler: I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Monica: (not buying it) Uh-huh.
Chandler: And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and
do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
Monica: (pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And,
are you kiddin’ me?!
Chandler: Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please?
Please-please, please?
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: Okay. (They hug.)

Janice’s Voice: (singing) My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You
make me high over my heart!

(Monica breaks the hug and starts for the bedroom.)
Chandler: So, are we going in there?
Monica: I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)

Janice’s Voice: (singing) You’re look for laughable…(She does
the now patented Janice laugh.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: The street in front of Central Perk, Ross is walking up and sees two women that
look like Phoebe and Rachel from behind.]
Ross: Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
[Cut to Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting up by the window because two guys
have their couch.]
Rachel: I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over… (She
starts to get up.)
Phoebe: (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!
(Ross appears at the window behind them crouched behind a garbage can and ready to
spring his attack on who he thinks are Phoebe and Rachel. The camera cuts to the exterior
view and Phoebe and Rachel call the shots from inside.)
Phoebe: Why is Ross doing that?
Ross: DANGER!!!!
Rachel: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Phoebe: We should help him!
Rachel: I… Well, I don’t think they need any help.
(Ross starts to scream and run away. He stops in front of the window of Central Perk to
check the pursuit and notices Phoebe and Rachel inside looking at him. He mouths,
"What?" Then realizes that the women he attacked are closing in so he screams
and runs away.)
EndRoss: (startled) Yeah?

Elizabeth: I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Ross: Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a
thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)

Elizabeth: Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my
evaluation…
Ross: That was you?

Elizabeth: Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a
student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Ross: Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.

Elizabeth: Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over; you’re not my
teacher anymore.
Ross: What time?

Elizabeth: (checks her grade) Oh, y’know what? Forget it, you already gave me
an A.
Ross: Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)

Elizabeth: I’m kidding!
Ross: Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, everyone minus Ross are arriving to inspect the damage.
The fire department is still there.]
Phoebe: Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a
cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through! 
(They start to look around seeing that the living room is undamaged.)
Monica: Oh well, it’s not so bad. 
Fireman #1: Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Phoebe: Oh!
Rachel: My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
Joey: (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this
Thursday?
Fireman #1: Excuse me?
Monica: Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look good in
that.
(Phoebe and Rachel return)
Joey: Oh, how bad is it?
Phoebe: Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that
isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Chandler: How’s your room Rach?
Rachel: Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue
sweater. (Hold it up.)
Monica: Isn’t that mine?
Rachel: Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)
Fireman #1: So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you
ladies have a place to stay?
Rachel: (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be
hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Monica: (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.
Chandler: Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Fireman #1: Well uh, do either of you smoke?
Phoebe: No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Fireman #1: No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Phoebe: Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me!
It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Rachel: Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To
the fireman) I warned her about those candles.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is on the phone as Joey enters.]
Chandler: God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long
it’s been!
Joey: Chandler, is that… (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler
nods yes.)
Chandler: (on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you.
Joey: Hey-hey listen… (Chandler waves him away.)
Chandler: Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes
throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and
cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!
Joey: When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Chandler: (on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that
sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He
hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
Joey: Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know
it’s Thursday, but what time?
(Monica enters.)
Chandler: Hi.
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: (To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her
to coffee and then we’ll do it then.
Joey: Ah-ha!
Monica: Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?
Chandler: Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years!
You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them
for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Monica: You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re
y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Chandler: No, we only went out once.
Monica: You dated her!
Chandler: Not once!
Monica: All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey
a favor?!
Joey: Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns
around to see Chandler glaring at him.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is having coffee with Dana.]
Chandler: (laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie
business.
Dana: Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Chandler: (giggles) My friend’s name is Joey.
Dana: Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks
me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know I-I-I haven’t
spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Chandler: Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.
Dana: No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee
first!
Chandler: The nerve huh?
Dana: Yeah!
Chandler: Refill?
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is about to debut Hotel Monica (formerly known as
Rachel’s Room) to Phoebe and Rachel.]
Monica: Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
(They walk into a completely redecorated and repainted room. And of course, the room is
immaculate. Only an obsessive-compulsive like Monica could find fault with the room.)
Rachel: Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
Monica: I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s
only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.
Phoebe: Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should
get to stay here.
Rachel: Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an
accident.
Phoebe: Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Rachel: Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
Monica: So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll
just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring
them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Rachel: I have.
[Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey is showing Phoebe around.]
Joey: This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And
uh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)
Phoebe: What’s that smell?
Joey: I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
[Scene: A street, Ross is walking with Elizabeth on their date.]
Elizabeth: Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Ross: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Elizabeth: Who?
Ross: Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came
up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Elizabeth: Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Ross: Umm, no. No.
Elizabeth: Yes you did! What was it?
Ross: Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.
Elizabeth: Ohh that’s so sweet!
Ross: Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how
before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I
thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
Burt: (exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!
Ross: (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are cleaning up the mess.]
Phoebe: So did you sleep well last night?
Rachel: I did. 
Phoebe: Yeah?
Rachel: I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Phoebe: Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Gum!
Fireman #2: Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Phoebe: Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
Fireman #2: No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s looks
like a curling iron.
Phoebe: I don’t use a curling iron.
Fireman #2: Well someone does.
(Phoebe looks at Rachel.)
Rachel: Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight!
Straight! Straight!
Fireman #2: It could’ve been a hair straightener.
Rachel: Oh.
[Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey is now showing Rachel around.]
Joey: This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.)
And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is reading and Monica runs over and turns on the
lamp behind Phoebe.]
Monica: Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Phoebe: Thanks Monica!
Monica: Does that smell bother you?
Phoebe: What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Monica: Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to
cover it.
Phoebe: I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Monica: Okay!
Phoebe: Okay.
(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
Monica: Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s for
you. It’s the fire inspector.
Phoebe: Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)
Really?!
[Cut to Joey’s, he’s on the phone.]
Joey: (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair
straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it
was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the
first things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh…
Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)
[Scene: Joey's apartment, Ross is telling Monica and Joey about his date with
Elizabeth.]
Ross: We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought
the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)
(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
Monica: So it’s okay to date a student.
Ross: Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the
rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last
night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Monica: Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation
as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents. 
Ross: Yeah. What-what should I do?
Joey: Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What
people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Monica: Joey that is so sweet.
(He turns his back to Monica and does the international sign for big boobies again.) 
Chandler: (entering) Hey.
Joey: Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a
block of time open say Thursday?
Chandler: I couldn’t do it.
Joey: You couldn’t do it?!
Chandler: Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
Monica: What?! You’re going out with her again!
Ross: Going out with who?
Chandler: Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Ross: Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big
boobies.)
Chandler: No, that was Dana Caplin.

The Guys: Ohhhh! (They all look up in a moment of reflection.)
Monica: Joey! You didn’t even know her!
Joey: Ah whatever!
[Scene: A Restaurant, Chandler is having dinner with Dana.]
Chandler: Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Dana: Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should
stay!
Dana: Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way
about you.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!
Dana: I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I
don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel
better.
Chandler: No-no—Really?!
Dana: Of course!
Chandler: (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…
Dana: Ohh, I’m sorry.
Chandler: Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Dana: What?! Anything! Anything! 
Chandler: Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I
have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this
umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on
Thursday?
Dana: Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if
your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Chandler: Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs
off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
[Scene: Hotel Monica, Phoebe is on the bed playing her guitar as Monica enters.]
Monica: Hey! How’s it goin’?
Phoebe: Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Monica: Yes it has! I made cookies!
Phoebe: Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato
chips.
Monica: But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.
Phoebe: Okay. (Reaches for one.)
Monica: (pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em
in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Phoebe: (gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second.
Monica: Okay!
(Monica leaves and Phoebe closes the door behind her and tries to lock it.)
Monica: (opening the door) What are you doing?
Phoebe: That doesn’t lock does it?
[Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Rachel are eating spaghetti in the living room while

Joey: Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Rachel: Really?
Joey: Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)

eats it.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Elizabeth are deciding what to do on their second date.]

Elizabeth: Uhh, I can’t.
Ross: Oh, you have some studying to do?
Elizabeth: No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Ross: Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to…
(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
Elizabeth: What are you doing?
Ross: Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!
Elizabeth: Do you not want to be seen with me?
Ross: What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Elizabeth: Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave.
Ross: What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what
people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with
that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)
Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Elizabeth: Hi!
Lydia: Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class?
Ross: That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re
dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.
Mel: You are so fired.
Ross: What?
Burt: They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’s
against the rules.
Ross: Really? Its not just frowned upon?
[Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Rachel are throwing huge spitballs at the
entertainment center.]
Rachel: I love it at Joey’s!
Joey: Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)
Chandler: (entering, sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice! 
Rachel: Thanks!
Chandler: (To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?
Joey: Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was
supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.)
You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)
Chandler: Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you
get the part?
Phoebe: (entering) Hey! Hi!
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started
the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell
you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just
face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at
Joey’s.
Rachel: No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what?
I’m fine here.
Phoebe: Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Chandler: Really?
Phoebe: Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Chandler: No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me
crazy!
Joey: That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.
Rachel: No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I
can throw wet paper towels here!
Phoebe: No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
Rachel: I know. I’m sorry.
Phoebe: All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet
paper towels.)
Joey: Yeah. 
Phoebe: God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is looking at his handbook. Elizabeth is also there.]
Ross: Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot
plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Elizabeth: For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It
felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Ross: I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s
against the rules. It’s forbidden.
Elizabeth: Wow!
Ross: What?
Elizabeth: Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot.
Ross: Really?
Elizabeth: Yeah.
Ross: Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s
wrong.
Elizabeth: Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)
Ross: (feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s
naughty. It’s taboo.
Elizabeth: Shut the book!
(They frantically start making out.)
Ross: Let’s also get a hot plate!
(They start making out again.)

yourself!

Rachel: Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
Monica: Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad
with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look
back.) Okay…

  It's the sequence where Joey and Chandler are both saddened that they're not living
together anymore. All By Myself is playing in the background.]
[Joey's place. He goes to say something to Chandler in the other chair but no one's
there. He goes to call Chandler but decides not to and throws the phone back down.]
[Chandler's. He's playing foosball by himself.]
[Joey's. Playing ping pong by himself.]
[Chandler is sitting in front of a window while it's raining outside. We see Joey
through a rainy window. The camera zooms out to show it's just his tabletop water
sculpture.]
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Chandler is entering with a peace offering of a
Joey Special, two pizzas.]
Chandler: Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings
and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes
what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey’s
not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a
chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the
actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey
the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.)
Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked.
(Pause) By dog not flowers.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey is entering to find Chandler waiting
patiently for him.]
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Please tell me you got the message!
Joey: What message?
Chandler: The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2
o’clock.
Joey: What?! It’s 6 o’clock!
Chandler: Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board,
then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the
coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Joey: I can’t believe this Chandler!
Chandler: Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.
Joey: Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to
the audition! I got the part!!
Chandler: (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over
here!
Joey: Oh, well I’m uh…
Chandler: Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Joey: Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Chandler: Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m
incredibly happy for ya!!
Joey: (shocked) That’s mean! You really had me going there!
Chandler: Oh, we could do this all day.
Joey: Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a
huge star I’m gonna be!
Chandler: You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
Joey: You hug me!
Chandler: All right!
[What follows is the final set of flashbacks that feature a whole lot of lovin’
between Chandler and Joey. There’s no words, just hugs and even the kiss from The One
With The Monkey. All of this is set to the song, You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me!]
[Cut back to the present, they are still in each other’s embrace.]
Joey: Hey, do we do this too much?
Chandler: I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Joey: Yeah.
(They separate.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey and Phoebe are reading a scene from Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E.]
Joey: Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your
backup source through your primary CPU.
Phoebe: (overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re
fried I tell you!!
Joey: Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry
you.
(Suddenly Ross jumps up from behind the counter armed with a plastic gun. By the way,
he’s overacting too.)
Ross: That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when
you’re dead!
Joey: Ross, you don’t have to yell.
Ross: There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. 
Phoebe: I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,
"Ooh, where’d Ross go?"
Ross: Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
Phoebe: Yeah?
Ross: Oh my God. I mean…
Joey: Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your
help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
Phoebe: (To Ross) He’s holding us back.
Ross: Totally.
EndPaul: I get that a lot.
Ross: Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and
I’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’s
chair, but Paul steps in)—Yeah, why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and
you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your
head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica,
and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
Monica: Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day,
‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.
Phoebe: Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
Elizabeth: So uh, Monica is Ross’s sister.
Monica: And he’s a great brother!
Paul: I had a sister.
Monica: Ohh!
Paul: She passed away.

Monica and Phoebe: (sympathetic) Ohh!
Paul: Oh, you don’t have to do that every time.
Chandler: But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college.
Uh, funny story… (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn’t happy.)
You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?
Paul: A part of him did yes.
Ross: (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets
down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Chandler: Yes, we were just…
(Rachel runs in.)
Rachel: Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up!
When does Liz’s father get here?
Paul: I’m already here.
Rachel: Oh! Ross is sooo great!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is working on her book at the kitchen
table, Monica is on the couch, and Chandler is entering from the bathroom carrying a
package of toilet paper.]
Chandler: Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were
gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Monica: No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Chandler: No, the little girl creeps me out.
Monica: You said the baby.
Chandler: Why would the baby creep me out?
Monica: Why would the little girl creep you out?
Phoebe: (writing frantically) You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a
little slower? 
Chandler: This is going in your book?
Phoebe: Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the
pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Monica: What?! Excuse me!
Phoebe: And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as
it’s a compliment.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is there alone as Paul enters.]
Rachel: (seeing him) Oh hi!
Paul: Hi! Hi. (He’s looking around.) I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Rachel: Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch
cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Paul: No.
Rachel: All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)
Paul: Oh, here they are right here. (Picks them up from underneath the corner of
the couch.)
Rachel: Oh good.
Paul: Thanks for your help. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel: (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Paul: Just call me Paul.
Rachel: Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Paul: Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing
him. (Rachel laughs then starts looking at him.) Are you okay?
Rachel: You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Paul: Well, we were very young when we had her.
Rachel: Oh. We?
Paul: Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to… (He taps his index
fingers together.)
Rachel: Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are
you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’
Paul: I’m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Rachel: (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Paul: Yes I did.
Rachel: Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Phoebe is still writing in her book, Chandler
and Monica are in the kitchen as Joey enters.]
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: How was your first day?
Joey: Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Chandler: Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful
servants!
Joey: Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,
he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was
reaching for one! Ohh!
Phoebe: Well, why don’t you just get him fired?
Joey: I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know?
There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone
rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani. 
Estelle: (on the other end) Joe! I’m glad I found ya, I got an audition for
ya!
Joey: Wow!
Estelle: The thing is it’s kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part
doesn’t know he might be fired. It’s the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey: I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Estelle: Uh-oh!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Ross is entering looking for Joey, but instead he finds Paul
and Rachel making out on the couch.]
Ross: Joey?!
Paul: Hi Ross.
Rachel: I was just getting him to like you.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, scene is continued from earlier.]
Ross: Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
Rachel: Ross, Joey is not here.
Ross: Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here!
Rachel: Ross, it’s okay. You can come out.
Paul: Yeah Ross it’s okay, it’s me, Mr. Stevens.
Ross: (coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!
Paul: Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the
bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach. (Kisses her.)
Rachel: Bye!
Paul: I’ll call you later. Bye Ross. (Leaves)
Ross: What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Rachel: Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…
Ross: (incredulous) In your mouth?!
Rachel: No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours,
and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Ross: You were at the coffeehouse!
Rachel: Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Ross: He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s
weird!
Rachel: Wh—You dated my sister!
Ross: That was different!
Rachel: What? Why?!
Ross: This is weird for me!
Rachel: Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far
the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We
can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very
successful lawyer!
Ross: How is that important?
Rachel: Oh it’s important!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Joey is telling everyone about his impending
termination at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.]
Joey: Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac,
and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know
he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Monica: Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.
Joey: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Monica: No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls
C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Joey: That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm
tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but
stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
(Exits.)
Chandler: So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?
Monica: Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.
Chandler: Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
Phoebe: (writing in her book) "You wish."
Monica: Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Phoebe: I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.
Chandler: Who?
Phoebe: Marcia and Chester.
Monica: Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis!
Hmm!
Chandler: Hmm.
Monica: (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Chandler: Oh.
Phoebe: I see what you’re doing!
Monica: (still writing) Phyllis sees what I’m doing.
Chandler: Oh-oh.
Phoebe: Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
[Scene: Pier 59 Studios, Joey is walking up to C.H.E.E.S.E. and Wayne.]
Joey: Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)
Wayne: Don’t touch him!
Joey: Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level
with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even
have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second
chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.’s arm and pulls
it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that’s why you didn’t
want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.
Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! (A very
beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin’? (He and her go over to talk
and Wayne looks on with envy.)
[Scene: A Restaurant, Ross and Rachel are on their double date. Rachel is busy talking
Ross up.]
Rachel: So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly,
offered to take me.
Elizabeth: What a nice story!
Paul: So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young
girl to her high school prom.
Rachel: Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna
go to the bathroom.
Ross: Yeah, take your time. 
(Rachel heads for the bathroom.)
Ross: (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So
it wasn’t as bad as-as…
Paul: Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s
partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep
coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told
me and the many, many, (pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause)
you’re not (pause) all bad.
Ross: Not all bad.
Paul: And anyhow, I’m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to
understand that I (pause) still look at Lizzie like she’s a twelve-year-old girl.
Ross: Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Paul: I beg your pardon?
Ross: No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!
I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Paul: You have a son?
Ross: Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just
so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your
wife! (Realizes) Oh, I’m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It’s unbelievable!
Paul: Don’t worry about it, I just didn’t realize you were married.
(Rachel returns and hears that.) 
Rachel: Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean
that was just a big drunken mistake.
Ross: You’re back.
Paul: You two were married?!
Rachel: Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!
(Ross slams his head down on the table.)
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are entering and
they’re arguing.]
Monica: Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Chandler: We said seven!
Monica: We said six!
Chandler: The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at
seven, not at six.
Monica: Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this,
"Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"
Phoebe: (Turning around in the chair) Hi!
Chandler: Oh my good God.
Monica: Ugh!
Phoebe: I know what time you said.
Chandler: What?!
Phoebe: Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Monica: What time?
Phoebe: Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the
rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears
things up.
Chandler: (disgusted) What does it say?!
Phoebe: I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Chandler: Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are
the queen of everything.
Phoebe: Thanks! So are you.
Chandler: (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He’s
wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
Phoebe: (reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and
Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re
supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven.
Chandler: So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Phoebe: That’s right.
Monica: Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Phoebe: (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
[Scene: Joey’s Dressing Room, Joey and Chandler are there.]
Joey: I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!
Chandler: Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Joey: Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
(There’s a knock on the door and Joey answers it to Wayne.)
Wayne: Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Joey: Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined
my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)
Chandler: Hi, how are ya?
Wayne: Joey, Joey, I-I-I’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Joey: (incredulous) Why should I help you?!
Chandler: (whispering in Joey’s ear) The reason he just said.
Joey: (happily) What do you need?
Wayne: I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know
Sarah? 
Joey: Yeah?
Wayne: I wish I could talk to her.
Joey: What are you in love with her or something?
Wayne: Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Chandler: Yeah, I’ve been there my friend.
Wayne: Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk
to women like you do.
Joey: Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know?
It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you—(Off Chandler’s
look)—You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.
[Scene: A Restaurant, Rachel is still trying to talk up Ross, not to much success.]
Rachel: I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each
marriage.
Paul: How to make the next one even shorter?
Rachel: Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a
lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks at
her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
Paul: Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Ross: Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know,
I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but
respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…
Paul: Are you yelling at me?!
Ross: God no!
Elizabeth: Y’know what daddy? If you don’t like Ross, that’s
fine. It doesn’t matter to me, I’m gonna go out with him anyway.
Paul: Really?! (She nods in the affirmative.)
Ross: Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! (to
Paul) Still not yelling!
Paul: Wow. What can I say? (Pause, pointing at Ross) This doesn’t make me
like you any better!
Ross: That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.
Paul: Then we agree?
Ross: Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so.
Paul: Neither of us like Ross!
Elizabeth: I like Ross.
Ross: Ohhh! Kids!
Rachel: (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how
nice Ross is!
Ross: That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.
Rachel: Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Mac’s Office, Mac is talking to C.H.E.E.S.E. about their case.]
Joey: Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
C.H.E.E.S.E.: The shipment never made it through Omaha?
Joey: You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch
C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.’s next line.) It’s your line
C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it’s arms and
advancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!
(The camera cuts to Wayne who’s busy making out with Sarah and rubbing
C.H.E.E.S.E.’s controller on her back causing C.H.E.E.S.E. to go crazy. Joey starts
throwing books at C.H.E.E.S.E. to get him to stop.)
EndPhoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: So what-what is the exhibit.
Phoebe: It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.
Joey: Oh man! (Hits Chandler)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich
museum this weekend!
Ross: Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Monica: Oh that’s great!
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!
Ross: Why? What?
Monica: Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Ross: No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go,
y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah,
he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in
fossils, huh?
Rachel: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in
fossils.
Ross: Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings
(Paul enters) in his ear. 
(And walks up right behind Ross, and standard sitcom joke 2B follows with the person
being insulted standing right behind the person doing the insulting while the rest of the
people become frightened and try to warn the insulter about the insultee’s presence.)
Chandler: Ross.
Ross: Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s
need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause
y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and… 
(Paul reveals his presence by laughing, thus concluding standard sitcom joke 2B. Paul
then pulls Ross aside to have a little chat with him and tells the rest of the group that
he’ll just be one second.)
Paul: Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much,
I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.
Ross: Really? That okay, that’s great.
Paul: Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told
Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore.
Ross: All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Paul: Yes it does.
Ross: But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think
there’s really anything you can do about it.
Paul: I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and
have you fired.
Ross: Ohh! A man with a plan!
Opening Credits
[Scene: A Dry Cleaners, Joey is there with Phoebe and is trying to get his picture put
back amongst the other celebrities hanging on the walls.]
Phoebe: Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of
fame! Eek!
Joey: I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi
would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of
Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that
smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…
Phoebe: (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you
next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great
together!
(The dry cleaner finishes with the customer in front of Joey and they approach the
counter.)
Joey: Hey! So I’m back.
The Dry Cleaner: Who are you?
Joey: Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn’t remember)
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.)
Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a
new TV show.
The Dry Cleaner: (picking up a TV Guide) Show me in the table.
Joey: Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.
The Dry Cleaner: Well, then it’s not on the wall yet.
Joey: Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)
Phoebe: So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe?
Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet? 
(The dry cleaner just stares at her and she retreats.)
[Scene: The Morgan Chase Museum, the girls are entering.]
Monica: Oh, I love museums!
Rachel: Umm.
Monica: Soakin’ up all the culture.
Rachel: Yeah.
Monica: Where do you want to start?
Rachel: Ooh, the gift shop!
Monica: Yeah!
Phoebe: Hey, and then lunch.
Rachel: Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to
dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Phoebe: Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s
gay?
Rachel: What?! No! Why?!
Phoebe: No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
(A museum official enters with another man and woman.)
The Museum Official: (to the couple) You can put the aisle over here (points),
and put the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)
Rachel: I didn’t know you could get married here.
Monica: This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I
wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!
(Points to both places.) I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful
arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.) 
The Museum Official: (To Monica) May I help you?
Rachel: Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful
space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
The Museum Official: Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year
waiting list. Sorry! (She kinda storms out with the couple.)
Rachel: Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Monica: What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even
engaged.
Phoebe: Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged
in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s
four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else,
y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)
Rachel: Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two
years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.
Monica: Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Rachel: I’m gonna do it too!
Phoebe: Me too!
Rachel: Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Phoebe: I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?
Rachel: Oh Pheebs.
Phoebe: Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
Monica: Phoebe, that stuff is…
Phoebe: Don’t even get me started on yours!
[Scene: The Dry Cleaners, Joey is trying to get his picture up again.]
Joey: (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
The Dry Cleaner: I did.
Joey: All right, let’s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)
The Dry Cleaner: No! It don’t go up on the wall!
Joey: What—But you saw the show!
The Dry Cleaner: Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Joey: Dry cleaners?
The Dry Cleaner: Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Joey: Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
The Dry Cleaner: That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings
us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Joey: Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the
Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them!
That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.
The Dry Cleaner: I’ve never seen it!
Joey: Oh you should, it’s great.
(The Dry Cleaner stares at him and Joey retreats.)
[Scene: A Cabin in the Woods, Elizabeth is giving Ross a tour.]
Ross: This place is really beautiful!
Elizabeth: Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be
my Grandma’s.
Ross: Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not
her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?
Elizabeth: Sure!
(They fall to the couch and start to make out, but Ross stops suddenly.)
Elizabeth: Are you okay? What’s wrong?
Ross: Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Elizabeth: Well, whatever works for ya…
Ross: No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Elizabeth: Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
Big deal. Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding.
Ross: Yeah.
(They start making out again.)
Elizabeth: (quietly) Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Ross: (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then
sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh,
protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Elizabeth: I’ll just run to the store and get some.
Ross: Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.
Elizabeth: Do you know where the store is?
Ross: No.
Elizabeth: Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle? 
Ross: A little bit.
Elizabeth: (laughs) I’ll be back in ten minutes.
Ross: Okay.
Elizabeth: Why don’t you get in the hot tub and I’ll meet you there.
Ross: Ohh, okay.
(Elizabeth leaves and Ross starts to remove his clothing right there in the middle of
the living room where someone can see him. Of course, someone almost does, but he hears a
door opening and…)
Rachel: (from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a
beautiful house.
(Ross with his pants around his ankles tries to run, but Dr. Geller forgets that he has
his pants around his ankles and falls down trying to flee.)
Paul: (To Rachel) Thank you, it’s my mom’s. So this is the kitchen.
(Dr. Geller, the man with the Ph.D. in Paleontology, is trying to find a place to hide,
but this supposedly intelligent man in the hands of clich�d scriptwriters runs around
with his pants down around his ankles like one of the Three Stooges.)
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is reading the newspaper as the phone
rings. He let’s the machine answer it.]
Chandler: (on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if
you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we
are.
The Museum Official: (on phone) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
I’m calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation
and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it
is available… (Chandler runs to answer the phone.)
Chandler: (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens)
Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Paul’s Cabin, Paul and Rachel are sitting on the couch drinking wine and
talking.]
Rachel: It’s so secluded up here.
Paul: I know. I like it up here.
Rachel: I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down
her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She
reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and
causes Rachel to scream.)
Paul: What’s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
Rachel: No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would
you—actually, would you go check on that?
Paul: Honey, we don’t have any bears here.
Rachel: Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Paul: Okay. I’ll be right back. (Gets up and heads for the kitchen.)
Rachel: Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.)
What?! What are you doing here?!
Ross: What are you doing here?!
Rachel: I came with Paul!
Ross: Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Rachel: Get up!
Paul: (entering) Here you go honey! (Rachel kicks Ross back under the couch.)
Rachel: Ahh. Thank you!
Paul: Diet Coke. (Hands her the glass.)
Rachel: Op, ice. I need ice.
Paul: Okay.
Rachel: Thank you.
Paul: I’ll be right back. (He goes to get the ice.)
Ross: (under the couch) You and your ice.
Rachel: Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the
kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the
kitchen.)
Ross: (before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
Rachel: Go-go!
Paul: (entering) Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Rachel: Ohh, thank you.
Paul: I’m so happy that you’re here.
Elizabeth: (entering) Here I am!
Paul: (jumping up) Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth’s here! Who are you
talking to?
Elizabeth: Uh, you guys?
Paul: How did you know we were here?
Elizabeth: Umm…
Rachel: Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to
the closed garage.
Elizabeth: Obviously.
Paul: Elizabeth, what are you doing here?! (Motions that he brought Rachel here
to be alone with her.)
Rachel: Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Elizabeth: Yeah! Yep.
Rachel: Well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in)
and do your homework?
Elizabeth: Ohh, I wouldn’t do it in there. That’s my dad’s
bedroom.
Rachel: That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling)
That’s your dad’s bedroom!
Paul: Why are you yelling?
Rachel: Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is sitting at the kitchen table
staring at the phone as Monica enters.]
Monica: Hi, honey.
Chandler: (gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
Monica: What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Chandler: (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He
storms out.)
(Monica puts the groceries down and goes to check the answering machine and hears.)
The Museum Official: (on machine) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase
museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller. 
Monica: Oh no!
The Museum Official: (on machine) I want to let her know that there was a
cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our
facility, it is available…
Monica: Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!
Chandler: (on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The
machine beeps off.)
Monica: NOOOO!!!!!!!!

[Scene: The Dry Cleaner’s, Joey has brought in a bunch of laundry in another
attempt to get his picture on the wall, but the dry cleaner isn’t working right now.
Instead, a beautiful woman is working.]
Female Clerk: Can I help you?
Joey: Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up
on the wall?
Female Clerk: He’s not here right now.
Joey: Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him
that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor;
I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Female Clerk: Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up
there. (She makes eyes at him.)
Joey: Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You’re
the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)
[Scene: Paul’s Cabin, continued from earlier.]
Paul: So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Elizabeth: Oh no-no believe me, I’m leaving as soon as possible!
Paul: Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re
welcome—How much more homework do you have?
Elizabeth: Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to
solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Rachel: Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me
something from the car.
Paul: What do you need from the car?
Rachel: Surprise me.
Paul: (whispering) Okay. (Starts for the car.)
Rachel: (yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and
that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
(Rachel and Elizabeth go upstairs. Paul starts for the car, but notices his luggage is
still out and decides to take in into the bedroom.)
[Cut to his bedroom, Ross is listening at the door as Paul opens the door, trapping
Ross behind it. With Paul’s back turned Ross coils up like a snake and slitters
underneath the bed.]
Paul: (standing in front of a mirror and to himself) Just relax. Just relax
Paul, you’re doing great. (Ross moves a piece of luggage over so he can watch Paul.)
She likes you. She… Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y’know why? Because
you’re a (pause) neat guy. (Ross can’t believe what he’s hearing.) You are
the man. You are (pause) the man! (He opens his shirt and looks at his chest.) I still got
it. Nice and sexy. You’re just a love machine. (Starts singing) I’m just a
love machine and I won’t work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! (Flexes and grunts
loudly.) Showtime. (Starts to leave and starts singing.) I’m just a love machine,
yeah ba-by! (Grunts again and Ross is stunned.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Monica rushes in.]
Monica: Phoebe!
Phoebe: Yeah?
Monica: Have you seen Chandler?!
Phoebe: No! Why?
Monica: The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation
and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad
is this?!
Phoebe: Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
Monica: I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him
anywhere!
Phoebe: What are you gonna do?
Monica: Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure!
(Mimicking her.) "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Phoebe: Rachel said that!
Monica: Well Rachel’s not here! (Runs out.)
[Scene: The Dry Cleaner’s, Joey and Phoebe are entering to see if his picture is
on the wall.]
Phoebe: Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you
sign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire
picture.)
Joey: I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!
The Dry Cleaner: (entering) Son of a bitch!
Phoebe: Okay, maybe ask this guy.
The Dry Cleaner: You, get out of my shop!
Phoebe: Well, what did he do?
The Dry Cleaner: He went out with my wife!
Phoebe: Joey!
Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!
(The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)
The Dry Cleaner: That’s my wife!!! Get out! (Starts yelling at him in
Russian, and I’m betting he’s not saying pleasant things about him.)
Phoebe: Well, we should go.
Joey: Yeah.
[Scene: Paul’s Bedroom, Elizabeth is entering.]
Elizabeth: Ross? Ross?
Ross: Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up
into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the
window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re
going home, okay?
Elizabeth: Okay!
Rachel: (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in
there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
(Ross frantically starts to open the window as Paul enters and traps him halfway out
the window.)
Paul: Ross!
Rachel: Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
Ross: (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Paul: Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Elizabeth: Daddy!
Paul: You’re next!!
Elizabeth: Okay. I didn’t know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)
Paul: Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my
daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up
to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Ross: Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…
Paul: No, let me explain! Fired!!
Ross: All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you
and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)
Paul: (panicked) What? 
Ross: And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics
Paul’s flexing.)
Paul: Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is pacing, waiting for Chandler to
return. Chandler enters.]
Monica: (going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Chandler: I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named
Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of
those Chandler noises.)
Monica: Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names
down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?
Chandler: Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
Monica: Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe
and Rachel…
Chandler: Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me
were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who
are available by the way!
Monica: It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because
it doesn’t.
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Really?
Chandler: Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that
I’m just not ready…
Monica: I know! I know.
Chandler: Okay. (They hug.)
Monica: I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I was
really worried about you. (Exits.)
Phoebe: (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?
Chandler: Totally.
Phoebe: So did Heldi show you the place?
Chandler: Yeah, it’s beautiful.
Phoebe: I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Chandler: I know.
(They hug.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is going up to the counter.]
Joey: Hey Gunther.
Gunther: Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there
(points) wants the biscotti. 
Joey: Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Gunther: Do you still work here?
Joey: No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?
I’m sorry.
Gunther: Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Joey: Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)
EndFirst Dorm Guy: You put your balloons down!!
(Both opposing camps start screaming at each other to drop their weapons and surrender.
Finally, Ross steps in as a mediator.)
Ross: (screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a
temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
[Scene: The Charity Event, Mr. Thompson is announcing the winners of the silent
auction.]
Mr. Thompson: Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. (Pause.) It goes to
Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Rachel: Ugh! So close!
(Phoebe returns a with a tray full of different kinds of drinks.)
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Look! 
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: I got me some drinks!
Rachel: What are you doing?
Phoebe: Open bar!
Rachel: Well now it’s an empty bar.
Phoebe: You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t
you?
Mr. Thompson: And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot
gentleman’s day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! (Joey
suddenly gets excited.)
Joey: I won! That was my guess!
Rachel: What?! What?! What?!
Joey: I guessed 20,000!
Rachel: Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!
Joey: What?! I don’t have 20,000!
Mr. Thompson: Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
(Everyone applauds and he stands up slowly.)
Rachel: Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
Phoebe: Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding
again. Joey waves and does a salute.] 
[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are sitting at a table. Monica is checking
her makeup as Chandler suddenly has a horrifying thought and starts patting down his
pockets until he finds what he’s looking for and sighs in relief.]
Monica: What are you doing?
Chandler: (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under
God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It’s a
butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign
friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.) 
Monica: Are you okay?
Chandler: Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is
everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
Monica: Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can
I have your jacket?
Chandler: Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you
can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were
going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are
you okay? Are you okay?
Monica: (laughs) Are you sure you’re okay?
Chandler: Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now
and I think, the reason is you.
Monica: Ohh that’s sweet!
Chandler: Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I
couldn’t imagine growing old with…
(As he’s talking Monica notices someone familiar has just entered the restaurant.
Let’s see; I seem to remember him driving a Ferrari in Hawaii solving crimes
as a private investigator and as a certain eye doctor in more recent times.)
Monica: (interrupting him) Oh my God!
Chandler: (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let
me say it.
Monica: Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard’s back.)
Chandler: What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler
turns and looks) Oh, that’s Richard!
Monica: Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!
(Monica smiles then acts shocked. Chandler can’t believe she just did that.)
Richard: (approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!
Chandler: Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I did
that!
Monica: Hey, it’s good to see you!
Richard: You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Monica: Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I
see you got your mustache back.
Richard: Well, my nose got lonely.
Chandler: (to Richard’s date) And uh, you don’t have a mustache which
is good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.

Richard’s Date: Hi, I’m Lisa.
Chandler: Hi.
Richard: Oh, I’m sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica,
Chandler. We used to date.
Chandler: Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at
him.) See I, did it again.
Monica: Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?
Chandler: Yeah, I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
Monica: (to Richard) It’s good to see you
Matire'd: (to Richard) You’re table’s ready sir.
Richard: Oh. Good to see you guys.
Chandler: Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.)
Matire'd: (motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandler’s) Or
if you prefer, this table is available.
Richard: That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: The Charity Event, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are sitting at their table.]
Rachel: What were you thinking?!
Joey: I didn’t know it was an auction!
Rachel: Wh?!
Joey: I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Rachel: Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Joey: I don’t know! Charity?
Rachel: Ugh!
Phoebe: Well, just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way through
her tray of booze.)
Rachel: Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?
Phoebe: I’m just helping the kids!
Rachel: How is you drinking helping the kids?
Phoebe: Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Thompson: (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.
Joey: Oh hi!
Mr. Thompson: Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building
the youth center.
Joey: Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Mr. Thompson: I think it was valued at 19,000
Joey: (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad
news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.
(Mr. Thompson looks shocked and at Rachel, she suddenly starts laughing.)
Rachel: Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
Mr. Thompson: That’s good. Very good! (Walks away.)
(After he’s left, Rachel stops laughing and glares at Joey again.)
Joey: So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)
Rachel: (stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to
buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna
kill me!
Joey: Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!
Rachel: I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All
right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and
we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.
Joey: Okay.
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!
Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Rachel: Not great.
[Scene: The Restaurant, Monica and Chandler’s and Richard and Lisa’s tables
have been pushed together and they’re all eating and talking.]
Monica: And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.
Richard: And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Monica: So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going
at it right on the bathroom floor.
Lisa: (laughing) Oh my God!
{Transcriber’s Note: For further reading on the above story, please check out The One Where Joey Moves Out.}
Chandler: I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my
parents making love to the same guy.
(An awkward silence ensues.)
Richard: It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make a
toast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of
friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things
the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed."
Monica: Ohh.
Chandler: What?!
(They all drink.)
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning to find Ross
is there waiting for them.]
Ross: Oh my God, you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)
Chandler: (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we
got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Ross: Who?
Chandler: Richard!
Ross: What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s
right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.
Chandler: Oh you knew that. Good!
Monica: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Ross: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Monica: Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get
out of!
Ross: Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over
there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I
finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.
Monica: Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship
against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and
pauses) weighing stuff.
Ross: Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.
Monica: If the school finds out you’re fired.
Ross: Hmm.
Monica: She’s leaving for three months.
Chandler: For camp!
Ross: Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty
and…
Monica: Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a
future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in
consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!
Ross: No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly
no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.
Monica: Okay well I think…that’s your answer.
Ross: I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Chandler: Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not
careful you may not get married at all this year!
[Scene: The Charity Event, Rachel and Phoebe are sitting at the table as Joey
approaches.]
Joey: Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Rachel: Oh great!
Joey: (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Phoebe: Oh, okay.
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Phoebe: It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type
thingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)
Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Emil Alexander: That was me.
Phoebe: Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only
shakes it.) 
{Transcriber’s Note: Please correct my French here.}
[Cut to Joey and Rachel approaching table one.]
Joey: Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Mr. Bowmont: That’s me.
Joey: Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the
talking.)
Rachel: Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day
sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
Joey: You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.
Rachel: (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)
Mr. Bowmont: I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wife
would’ve killed me.
Rachel: Ohh…
Joey: Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!
Rachel: Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
Mr. Bowmont: It’s Pam.
Rachel: Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Joey: Aw-awww!
Mr. Bowmont: I don’t think she’d like that.
Rachel: Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Joey: Oooooh…
Mr. Bowmont: I don’t think so dear.
Rachel: Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to
him.) All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your
h—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that
you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You
can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and
then when you’re old, Cappy.
Mr. Bowmont: What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right!
Joey: No way! It’s mine!!
Rachel: (To Joey) What?! What?!
Joey: All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Rachel: But Joey you don’t have $20,000!
Joey: Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.
Bowmont!!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is taking out the garbage as Phoebe and
Joey enter. Phoebe gasps.]
Joey: Oh my God, you’re back!
Phoebe: Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically
trying to wave them off.)
Monica: Why do you want to see my hand?
Phoebe: I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. 
Joey: Yeah.
(Chandler puts his face in his hands as Joey and Phoebe start to examine the trash.)
Phoebe: Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.
Monica: (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe’s wishes.)
Chandler: (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
Phoebe: What happened?
Chandler: Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
Joey: What?! Noooo… (Phoebe gasps.)
Chandler: I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but
now you’ve ruined it!
Joey: We didn’t ruin it!
Chandler: Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
Phoebe: Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…
Joey: Glove salesman!
Phoebe: Good one! Yeah.
Chandler: This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Phoebe: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure,
so just throw her off the track.
Chandler: That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage
is the last thing on my mind.
Phoebe: Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment!
Convince her that you’re a little coward!
Chandler: I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.
Joey: Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)
Monica: (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot
keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Joey: That guy’s still doing that?!
Rachel: (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God
you’re here, let me see your hand!!
Phoebe: No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
[Scene: Outside of Elizabeth’s dormitory, Ross is exiting after breaking up with
her and we can hear his thoughts.]
Ross: (in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was
such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge
mistake?

Elizabeth: (sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!
Ross: Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…
Elizabeth: You suck!! 
Ross: What?!
(She throws a water balloon at him and hits him on the head and hits him again at the
waist with another one.)
Ross: Okay, break-up’s still on!
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is looking out the window and Joey is sitting on the
couch.]
Chandler: Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I
look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
Joey: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each
other.) I never noticed that before.
Monica: (entering) Hi guys!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: What are you up too?
Chandler: Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it
is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Joey: (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.
Monica: Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear
that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Chandler: Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why
would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Monica: Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To
declare your love for one another to the world!
Chandler: Eh…
Monica: Okay well that’s good to know.
(We hear the backup horn of a truck and see through the window that the Mr. Bowmont has
arrived.)
Joey: (all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! (Jumps over the back off the
couch and runs out into the street.)
[Scene: Monica’s Restaurant’s kitchen, she’s cooking as a waitress
sticks her head in.]
Waitress: Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef,
should I let him in?
Monica: Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)
Waitress: (to the customer) Come on in.
(The customer turns out to be…)
Richard: Hi!
Monica: Richard!
Richard: Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef.
Monica: Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to
complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?
Richard: Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Monica: Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Richard: No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause)
to tell you I still love you.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica’s Restaurant, continued from earlier.]
Monica: What uh—What did you—What?!
Richard: I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here
telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say
he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I
didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the
stupidest thing I ever did.
Monica: Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!
Richard: Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong
place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna
have kids with you.
Monica: Oh God… (Starts looking around.) Why don’t they put chairs
back here?!
Richard: I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Monica: What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years
ago?!
Richard: Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did!
Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get
you out of my head!
Monica: What were you doing in Africa?
Richard: Working with blind kids.
Monica: Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but
umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Richard: Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother
you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I
am.
Monica: Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in
fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!
Richard: You are?
Monica: Yeah!
Richard: Why?
Monica: Why? Because of the government.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is bringing Phoebe some coffee.]
Rachel: Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.
Phoebe: I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.
Rachel: Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that
happen?
Phoebe: Not that often!
Rachel: No! I’m so happy for them!
Phoebe: Me too! So happy for them!
Rachel: I’m so happy and not at all jealous.
Phoebe: Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
(They both take a drink of coffee.)
Rachel: I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean
what’s 2%? That’s nothing.
Phoebe: Totally. I’m like 90/10.
Rachel: Yeah me too.
(Joey enters looking like Captain Stubing from the Love Boat.)
Joey: Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Rachel: (staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here
looking for ya, Tennille.
[Scene: A Pizza Joint, Chandler and Monica are eating lunch.]
Monica: So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t
really believe that do you?
Chandler: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is
unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs
don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a
lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
Monica: Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!
Chandler: If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the
divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Monica: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never
want to get married?
Chandler: Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
Monica: Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Chandler: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of
strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
Monica: Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh! 
(She gets up and storms out. The people at the other tables are staring at Chandler.)
Chandler: (to them) It’s okay, I got a plan.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still talking.]
Rachel: We’re gonna find love!
Phoebe: Definitely!
Rachel: Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so
easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little
guarantee though.
Phoebe: What do you mean?
Rachel: Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither
of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.
Phoebe: You mean a backup?
Rachel: Exactly!
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah I got that.
Rachel: You do?
Phoebe: Hm-mmm.
Rachel: Who?
Phoebe: Joey.
Rachel: Joey?!
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: Are you serious?!
Phoebe: Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Rachel: Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re
40, you’re gonna marry Joey.
Phoebe: Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to
seal the deal.
Rachel: Oh, seriously?
Phoebe: Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking
sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
Rachel: Charming.
Phoebe: Well hey, it’s just a backup.
Rachel: Yeah.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, is practicing his
slipknots as Monica enters.]
Joey: Hey Monica!
Monica: Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Joey: This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Monica: Yeah, it’s great.
Joey: Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Monica: I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in
a dead-end relationship!
Joey: Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Monica: It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that
I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going
somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!
Joey: Well, you know Chandler.
Monica: No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s
like something’s changed.
Joey: Maybe you changed?
Monica: I didn’t change!
Joey: Maybe that’s the problem.
Monica: What?!
Joey: Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Monica: Is that some kind of boat talk?
Joey: I don’t know! (All excited) I haven’t totally decided how to
talk on my boat yet.
Monica: What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for
nothing?
Joey: Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Monica: (starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marry
me.
Joey: There are?
Monica: Yeah! Richard!
Joey: R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and
Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!
Monica: That’s right.
Joey: Chandler loves marriage!!
Monica: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex
fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always
will be!
Joey: You got that from what I said?!
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is watching a show about the extinction of the
dinosaurs.]

Narrator: When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Ross: What happened you guys?
(There’s a knock on the door, he shuts the TV off, and answers it.)
Ross: Rach!
Rachel: Hey you!
Ross: Hey, come on in.
Rachel: Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and
Elizabeth.
Ross: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but
uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
Rachel: Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?
Ross: I guess so.
Rachel: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the
time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and
we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises
there! You know what I mean? No like, "What’s that?!"
Ross: Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Rachel: Exactly.
Ross: Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Rachel: What? Who?
Ross: Phoebe.
Rachel: Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her
backup.
Ross: Ohh, I don’t think so.
Rachel: Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey
made a deal!
Ross: That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years!
We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is entering to find Joey, still
looking like Captain Stubing, on the phone.]
Joey: Where the hell have you been?!
Chandler: I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Joey: Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Chandler: What?!
Joey: Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with
her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep
flying off!
Chandler: My—Oh my God!
Joey: I know! They suck!!
Chandler: He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m
supposed to do that!
Joey: I know!
Chandler: Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go
over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
Joey: Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a
solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Chandler: You’re right.
Joey: Yeah!
Chandler: Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring!
I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for
the door) I’m just going to propose!
Joey: Okay.
Chandler: Okay great.
Joey: Dude-dude-dude!
Chandler: What?!
Joey: Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Richard’s Apartment, he’s smoking a cigar and reading a book as there
is a knock on the door. He gets up and opens the door to reveal…]
Monica: Hi.
Richard: Hi.
Monica: I don’t know why I’m here.
Richard: I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?
Monica: I don’t know.
Richard: Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the
couch. (Does so.)
Monica: (entering) Chandler is such an idiot!
Richard: (standing up quickly) Drink?
Monica: Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…
Richard: …on the rocks with a twist? I remember. (Goes to make her drink.)
Monica: (moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?
Richard: Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my art
out.
Monica: No that’s, that’s okay.
Richard: So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do
you ever, think about me?
Monica: Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Richard: Oh really?
Monica: Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new
eye doctor.
Richard: Who is it?
Monica: Edward Nevski?
Richard: Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause)
non-eye doctor way?
Monica: No.
Richard: Ahh.
Monica: But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do.
And I never let myself think about you.
(Richard mouths, "Wow!")
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is reading as Rachel enters.]
Rachel: Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Phoebe: Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look,
I’ve already lost Chandler!
Rachel: What?!
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Phoebe! We’re both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!
Ross: Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Phoebe: I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining
about now? You were both aware of the situation!
(At the same time.)
Joey: No we weren’t!
Ross: I was not!
Phoebe: Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!
Rachel: Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!
Joey: Pick me!!
Ross: No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
Phoebe: All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a
boat—This is hard!
Joey: This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Ross: Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
(Rachel gets all happy.)
Phoebe: No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys!
Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married,
three times a week.
Rachel: Oh God, Phoebe!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) I’m talking about massages.
Rachel: Oh. 
(She turns her head away and when she’s not looking, Phoebe shakes her head and
mouths, "No, I’m not." Both Joey and Ross smile, look at each other, and
then stop smiling.)
Rachel: Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right
here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so)
and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one!
And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Joey: Okay that’s fair.
Ross: All right.
Phoebe: Good!
(Rachel mixes them up in her hands, moves them all around, and puts her hands behind
her back.)
Rachel: Pick one.
Phoebe: Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold
and read them.) Thank you.
Rachel: You’re welcome.
Phoebe: (reading) Ross!
Rachel: (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.
Phoebe: Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
Joey: Yeah.
[Scene: Richard’s Apartment, Monica is looking around and notices an African mask
hanging on the wall.]
Monica: (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Richard: Excuse me?
Monica: Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.
Richard: Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!
Monica: I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment!
Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Richard: Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature.
Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Monica: Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to
be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work
and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t
want that!
Richard: I think that’s fair.
Monica: Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve
been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to
marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Richard: It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh. 
Monica: Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks
up at his eyes.) I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…
Richard: I know. (Backs away.)
Monica: Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know,
some stuff before I can…
Richard: Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, even
twenty minutes if you need it. I’ll be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)
[Scene: Richard’s Apartment, time lapse. Richard is smoking as he hears a knock on
the door. He quickly puts out his cigar and opens the door.]
Richard: Chandler.
Chandler: Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks
in.)
Richard: She’s not here and please come in.
Chandler: (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a
coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Richard: Okay, she was here, but she left.
Chandler: Well where did she go?
Richard: Well she said she had to think things over.
Chandler: Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I
thought you were a good guy.
Richard: Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Chandler: Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that
you love her?
Richard: Well all right, one thing happened?
Chandler: Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did?
My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Richard: Well I’m sorry.
Chandler: And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Richard: Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.
Chandler: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a
plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these
things, she’d be surprised!
Richard: Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Chandler: It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this
isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And
this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each
other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna
propose tonight.
Richard: You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)
Chandler: Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did
you get a ring?
Richard: No I don’t have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause)
And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me.
Chandler: Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
Richard: I know. (Pause) I hate that!
(Chandler gets up and runs out, but as soon as the door closes behind him he opens it,
runs back in, picks up his ring Richard is holding up for him, and runs back out.)
[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler is running up the stairs and towards his apartment, but
Joey is taking out the garbage at the same time and stops him in the hall.]
Joey: Dude!
Chandler: I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Joey: She’s gone.
Chandler: What?
Joey: She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.
Chandler: What are you talking about?
Joey: She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that
and that she needed time to think.
Chandler: Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her
it was a plan?!
Joey: I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe
me.
Chandler: Well where… Where did she go?
Joey: To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But
if I were you I would.
Chandler: I can’t believe I ruined this.
Joey: I am so sorry man.
(He walks dejectedly into his apartment to find it lit with about a thousand candles
and Monica standing in the living room.)
Monica: You wanted it to be a surprise.
(He turns to look at Joey who smiles slyly and closes the door leaving them alone.)
Chandler: Oh my God.
(Monica gets down on one knee.)
Monica: Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.
(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a
reason why girls don’t do this!
Chandler: Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought…
(Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it
mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is
that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry
again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you
feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
Monica: Yes.
(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger. They hug and kiss this time as
an engaged couple.)
Monica: I knew you were likely to take a wife!
(They hug again.)
Joey: (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
Monica: Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
We’re engaged!!!
(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)
Rachel: Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
Phoebe: Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!
Monica: Oh…
Rachel: Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!
Joey: Yeah!
(They all hug again.)

Chandler: Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had
a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
[Rachel exits into the hallway just as Ross is coming up the stairs.]
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Wow! Happy Monica’s night!
Rachel: Well thank you, you too.
Ross: Thanks.
Rachel: Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting
married?
Ross: Well sure. But I get married all the time so…
Rachel: Ohh…
Ross: You okay?
Rachel: Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna
have that?
Ross: You mean, we—you and me?
Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Ross: Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Rachel: Shake it off.
Ross: I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you
and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.
Rachel: No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…
Ross: Surely you can think of something good.
Rachel: Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one
good thing.
Ross: What?
Rachel: Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.

Ross: (to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at
the stuff too.
Rachel: Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh
no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!
Ross: A what?
Rachel: Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they
get back together for just one night.
Ross: One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Rachel: Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
Ross: No.
[Silence.]
Ross: Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it
would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good
idea. Y’know? I really, really…don’t.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is playing Playstation, Crash Team Racing
to be exact (he’s in last on Hot Air Skyway to be more exact) as Joey enters from his
room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. He’s got the wool cap, he’s
got the cut-off Knicks jersey over the faded T-shirt, and he’s got the whole
pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have
adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like they’re from
the inner-city.]
Joey: ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?
Chandler: (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don’t
hurt me.
Joey: So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s
whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation,
‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Chandler: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look,
you are definitely 19.
Joey: Come on man, really how old?!
Chandler: Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because
everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Joey: Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
Chandler: Joe?
Joey: Yeah!
Chandler: Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?
Joey: When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Chandler: Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind
of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t….
There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
Joey: Don’t worry about that man, that happens.
Chandler: It’s happened to you?
Joey: Yeah! Once.
Chandler: Well, what’d you do?
Joey: I did it anyway.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the living room and Phoebe is in
her room.]
Monica: Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe
enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren’t you dressed yet?!
Phoebe: I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.
Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)
Monica: (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if
you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.
Phoebe: Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,
if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Monica: Fair enough, now go get ready!
Phoebe: Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
Monica: I’ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating
my—(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.)
I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from before the commercial break.
Monica is walking into the apartment followed by Ross and Rachel.]
Ross: Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…
Monica: (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Rachel: What?
Monica: See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some
people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is
selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about
that.
Rachel: Oh honey, but it is just about…
Ross: It is! It is!
Monica: No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back
together!
Rachel: What?!
Monica: See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Ross: Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not
getting back together!
Rachel: Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Ross: Yeah!
Monica: That’s true.
Rachel: Honey I swear it we just kissed. 
Ross: It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
Phoebe: You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting
back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Monica: Thunder being stolen!!
Rachel: Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!
Ross: Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time
thing. It doesn’t even matter!
(Chandler and Joey enter and overhear that.)
Joey: Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems
in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the
best he can!!
Chandler: (angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking about
Joe!!
Phoebe: What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed…
(Points to Ross and Rachel.)
Joey: What? 
Chandler: What?!
Joey: You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!
Rachel: No!
Ross: Oh no!
Rachel: No-no, it’s really not huge.
Ross: And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we
are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
Monica: Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?
Phoebe: Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem.
Joey: Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it
make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Monica: Yes that would be lovely.
Joey: You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Chandler: Yes, you can pass for 19.
Joey: Really?
Chandler: Yes!
Joey: Seriously?
Chandler: Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Joey: (gasps) I’m 30!
Rachel: Joey, you are not! You’re 31.
Joey: (realizes) Aww crap!
Phoebe: Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s,
(To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.
Monica: Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The
Plaza.
Phoebe: Why?!
Rachel: Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…
Monica: No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! (To
Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)
Joey: Psss, that is whack!
[Time lapse, Phoebe is playing the guitar for Joey.]
Phoebe: (she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think
I’ll play it at the wedding.
Joey: Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I
mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then
they just take it away like-like, "No you don’t."
Phoebe: Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.
Joey: Wouldn’t she?
Phoebe: Would she?
Joey: Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You
ate my candy bar!
[Scene: Rachel’s bedroom, she’s pacing as Ross knocks on her door and opens
it a little to stick his hands in.]
Ross: Guess who? (Enters fully.)
Rachel: Hey.
Ross: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…
Rachel: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to
talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there
kissing.
Ross: Still thinking about it huh?
Rachel: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?
(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
Ross: (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?
Rachel: I care!
Ross: (tightening his tie) And so do I.
Rachel: Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get
changed?
Ross: Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Ross: (sitting up) No! (Exits.)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s bedroom, they are both getting undressed.]
Monica: I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so
typical.
Chandler: Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is
going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s
going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Monica: Paris?
Chandler: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
Monica: Keep talking.
Chandler: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just
because it’s romantic, but because I can!
Monica: I love you!
(They start making out and both start to feel something growing below the belt line.)
Monica: (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.
Chandler: Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.
(There is a knock on the door.)
Chandler: It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!
Monica: (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what’s up? (She enters.)
Phoebe: Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need
a small deposit.
Monica: What?!
Phoebe: Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Chandler: Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Phoebe: Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)
[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)
Joey: They break your heart, don’t they?
Phoebe: Y’know, I don’t really their permission.
Joey: Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Phoebe: Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something
about your eyes.
Joey: What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.
Phoebe: They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom
in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Joey: And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?
Phoebe: Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
[Cut back to Monica and Chandler’s room, they are making out again as there’s
another knock on the door.]
Chandler: Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!
(Monica opens the door to Ross and Rachel.)
Monica: Yes.
Rachel: Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to
talk to anyone, especially me?
Chandler: What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Rachel: No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Monica: Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve
stolen my thunder.
Rachel: What?!
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, here’s a thought.
(Rachel ignores him and follows Monica into the kitchen.)
Rachel: Monica, what are you talking about?
Monica: My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin
Charlie.
Chandler: (entering) Ahh, third base.
Monica: It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!
Rachel: Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your
party was so boring!
Monica: (gasps) We had a characturist!
Rachel: Oh!! 
Phoebe: (singing, angrily) 


"Whenever I get married, guess who won’t get to sing?
    Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"


(Exits.)
Rachel: Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Monica: And yet, here we are doing it again.
Rachel: Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!
Monica: Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Ross: Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
Rachel: All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna
happen!
Monica: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Rachel: I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Monica: Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Ross: Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting
together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.
Chandler: (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from
your night?
Monica: I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little
resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t
stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Rachel: Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what?
Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!
(Ross tries to dismiss it by making that sound, but decides to go for it and follows
Rachel.)
Monica: (yelling after them) I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on
my engagement night!!
Chandler: Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
[Cut to Rachel’s bedroom.]
Ross: Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…
Rachel: We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think
that we’re doin’ it.
Ross: Oh, I see, so everybody wins. 
(There’s a knock on the door.)
Rachel: Who is it?
Monica: (outside the door) It’s Monica, open up!
Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to
follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
Ross: Oww!
Rachel: Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May
we help you?
Monica: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that
you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your
engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!
Chandler: How is that ever going to happen?!
Rachel: All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Monica: I know why!
Rachel: No you don’t know why!
Monica: Okay! Why?!
Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.
Monica: What do you mean?
Rachel: Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just
reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know,
maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh
my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
(Ross looks at Chandler.)
Chandler: (To Ross) I don’t care, she slept with me.
Rachel: Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.
Monica: (starting to cry) I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
(They hug.)
Ross: (deadpan) Well, I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations
man.
Chandler: Thanks.
Ross: (at the door) And uh, Rachel.
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person
who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes
what he said and exits disgustedly.)

Chandler’s door.]
Phoebe: (singing)

    That’s right, I’m here all night, and Chandler will never get l…"



Chandler: (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it
a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Phoebe: Oh thank you.
Chandler: Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
Phoebe: Now… (Starts singing again) "Who will perform the ceremony!
Who will perform the cer—(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the
door behind him)—Oh—oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning.
EndChandler: Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I
kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Phoebe: (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.
Chandler.
Monica: This is the most special day of our lives.
Chandler: No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the
money on one party.
Monica: Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a
party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always
earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.
Chandler: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer
is no.
Monica: You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?
Chandler: Yes, I am!
Phoebe: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Rachel enters and sees Joey sitting
there.]
Joey: Hey Rach.
Rachel: (quietly) Joey.
Joey: Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Rachel: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Joey: No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on
fire.
Rachel: Well no, I don’t smell anything.
Joey: Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.
Ross: (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Rachel: Nothing!
Ross: (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I
heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
Rachel: Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Ross: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Rachel: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with
you. (Exits.)
Ross: (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons
of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?
Phoebe: (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Ross: (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?
Phoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy
that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Ross: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Phoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Ross: Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him
accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a
mop.
Phoebe: Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars
a week!
Ross: Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that
didn’t move his-his appointment.
Phoebe: Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You
could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down
his back!
Ross: He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m
sorry.
Joey: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Ross: His daughter was hot.
Joey: Gotcha.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as
Monica enters.]
Monica: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask
you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for
that.
Chandler: Ehh.
Monica: Eh, you work for that.
Chandler: Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should
spend all of the money on the wedding.
Monica: You do?!
Chandler: Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told
you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes
you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.
Monica: Oh, you’re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about
our, what about the future and stuff?
Chandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,
y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Monica: You thought about that?
Chandler: Yeah.
Monica: How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Monica: What else did you think about?
Chandler: Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place
outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know,
we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it
ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.
Monica: (laughs) Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.
Chandler: Sure you do.
Monica: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Chandler: You sure?
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Chandler: I love you so much.
Monica: I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were
talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Chandler: Oh yeah, totally!
Monica: Oh good.

Rachel: Who are you supposed to be?
Joey: The vicar!
Rachel: Do you even know what a vicar is?
Joey: Like a goalie, right?
Rachel: (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep
making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m
not—it’s just not funny anymore!
Joey: All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m
sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)
Rachel: All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?!
Let’s do it!
Joey: Huh?
Rachel: (starting to move closer to him) That’s right, I wanna do it with
you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Joey: (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)
Rachel: (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’
so long to get on that body!
Joey: This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)
Rachel: Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Joey: Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife
there in-in chapter seven.
Rachel: Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,
I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! (He backs into
the door.)
Joey: I don’t want to, I’m scared.
(Rachel walks away, pleased with her self.)
EndChandler: So, what do you think?
Ross: About what?

hint. (Points to his glasses.)
Joey: Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!
Chandler: I got glasses!
Ross: Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.
Chandler: No I didn’t!
Ross: Are you sure?
Rachel: Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really
round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…
Joey: Feminine.
Rachel: Yes!
Chandler: No!
Monica: Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: Yeah!
Chandler: (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used to
wear glasses, right?
Monica: Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the
gang.)
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are making
some sandwiches.]
Phoebe: So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Chandler: That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so
you don’t have to get us…
Monica: (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t
want to deprive them of that joy.
Rachel: Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh,
portable CD players.
Monica: Oh, I already have one. 
Phoebe: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Monica: Hey, I know I what I want!
Chandler: What we want honey.
Monica: No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s
cookie recipe.
Phoebe: You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Monica: Uh-huh, yeah.
Phoebe: You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that
I would never let out of our family?
Chandler: Dying people say the craziest things.
Monica: I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Phoebe: Break my heart—Oh, all right.
Monica: Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best
chocolate chip cookies.
Chandler: Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
Joey: (entering) Ahoy!
Chandler: Hey! How’s the boat?!
Joey: Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Monica: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Joey: Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Phoebe: If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Joey: Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang
around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks
a beer, and eats a chip.)
Chandler: Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.
Rachel: Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Joey: You could?
Rachel: Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad
bought me my own boat.
Phoebe: Your own boat?
Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there. He takes off his glasses and
starts chewing on the ear piece.]
Chandler: Do you know what I was thinkin’?
Monica: What?
Chandler: Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
Ross: (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Chandler: Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Ross: No, why?
Chandler: Then free as a bird. What’s up?
Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Monica: Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask
just anyone to play.
Ross: Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed
he meant you.
Chandler: Well, did-did you correct him?
Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Monica: This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Ross: Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the
trash cans. He does that every week too.
Monica: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: He hates to lose.
Chandler: Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.
Ross: You’re not a lefty? 
Chandler: Does anybody know me?!
(Phoebe enters, walks up to Monica, and exhales exasperatedly.)
Monica: What’s wrong Phoebe?
Phoebe: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the
stupid fire burned it up!
Monica: No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box
and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Phoebe: (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal!
That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an
engagement present.
Ross: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Chandler: Don’t worry about it Pheebs.
Ross: No one got me an engagement present.
Phoebe: Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie
in a plastic baggie.) 
Chandler: An old cookie?
Monica: (To Chandler) This is what happens when you don’t register for
gifts!
Phoebe: See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Chandler: We can’t accept this.
Phoebe: Why not?
Chandler: ‘Cause it’s gross.
Monica: No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do
stuff like this at work all the time.
Phoebe: Really?!
Monica: Yeah! I bet I can do it.
(Chandler looks over and sees Ross glaring at them.)
Chandler: Okay, we owe you a present.
Ross: Two! I’ve been engaged twice!

waterways around New York, but in reality she’s in a sound stage on the Warner Bros.
lot and we see New York from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. Rachel and
Joey are on board.]
Joey: (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger
boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To
Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Rachel: That is the Coast Guard. 
Joey: What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.
(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
Rachel: Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the
lesson yet.
Joey: All right.
Rachel: Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,
are you ready?
Joey: Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I
want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)
Yo-ho-ho!
Rachel: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a
little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick
question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?
Joey: Uh, boat rope.
Rachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Joey: Uhh, rub it?
Rachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Joey: I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this
one, uh…
(Rachel blasts an air horn in his ear.)
Rachel: Time’s up, now your dead.
Joey: And deaf!
Rachel: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not
know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you
sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
Joey: Yes.
Rachel: Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get
hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Joey: I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Phoebe are trying to determine the
cookie recipe by eating small pieces.]
Monica: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Phoebe: You do?
Monica: You don’t? (Laughs) Well, that’s the difference between a
professional and a layman.
Phoebe: That and arrogance.
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Monica: Hey! How was sailing?
Joey: I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at
least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what’s left of the cookie and pops in his
mouth.)

Monica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Joey: (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
Phoebe: I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my
grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out
to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Ross: (entering with Chandler) Hey.
Monica: Hey! How was it?
Ross: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…
Chandler: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We
were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Ross: And what did he ask you not to call him?
Chandler: Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler
about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished
playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was
really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way
around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and
that’s when in happened.
[Cut to the flashback, Chandler’s no longer doing the voice-over.]
Chandler: Guys?
Ross: Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
Mr. Geller: Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door
as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits
next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is finished telling everyone what
happened.]
Monica: Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!
Chandler: I know.
Monica: You gave my father a lap dance!
Chandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Ross: ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
Chandler: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Phoebe: Come on, it’s not that big a deal!
Chandler: Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
Ross: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to
bond to that part?
Monica: Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought
this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!
Chandler: I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
Ross: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from
fat camp.
Monica: I wasn’t escaping.
Ross: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Monica: I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Ross: You were trying to eat it!
(The phone rings.)
Chandler: If that is your father calling to tell this story then the
marriage is off!
Monica: (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens)
I’m sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I’ll call you
later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are there.]
Chandler: (getting up) All right, I’m off to see your dad.
Ross: Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?
Rachel: (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Chandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story
anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I
don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Rachel: I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.
Ross: Thank you!
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey? 
Joey: Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Rachel: Why not?
Joey: Because! You’re mean on the boat!
Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.
Joey: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Ross: Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her
dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.
Rachel: Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms
because you were wearing three life jackets.
Ross: You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
Rachel: Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta
tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all
the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Joey: Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Rachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Joey: Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Rachel: Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!
Joey: Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had
finished that last beer.
Rachel: All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it
down and uh stop yelling.
Joey: You won’t boss me around anymore?
Rachel: I won’t boss you around.
Joey: And you’ll be nice?
Rachel: And, I’ll be nice.
Joey: And you’ll be topless?
Rachel: And—Joey!
Joey: Do you want me to learn?!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is trying out different cookie recipes.
Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.]
Monica: Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like
your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Ross: Let’s give it a shot.
Monica: Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the
ninth grade.
Phoebe: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Monica: No, just a Friday night.
(They all take a bite.)
Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.
Phoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Ross: Which one was that?
Monica: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Ross: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a
little bit.) I’m okay.
Phoebe: Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work
off of those.
Ross: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (Grabs a
cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16
people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, its Joey’s second lesson with Rachel as the resident
sailing expert.]
Rachel: Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m
just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which
side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Joey: Ohh yeah.
Rachel: Right?
Joey: Nope.
Rachel: It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a
tough one.
Joey: I don’t know why you just don’t say left.
Rachel: Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of
the boat.) The left!
Joey: Huh?
Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
Joey: (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?
Rachel: No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Joey: Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me
a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)
Rachel: Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the
cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working
efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
Joey: Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.
Rachel: Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
Joey: Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead
with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Rachel: (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not
see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson!
I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which
obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Joey: All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you
taking your top off! I quit!
Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!
Joey: Why not?!
Rachel: Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do
not quit!
Joey: Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Rachel: Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit
didn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!
Joey: Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!
Rachel: No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you.
Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so
hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Joey: Well, hey I did learn.
Rachel: Really?
Joey: Yeah! Come on.
Rachel: Awww…
Joey: Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It’s
the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is
right.
Rachel: Left.
Joey: Damnit!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the cookie trying period has pasted. Monica,
Phoebe, and Ross are reflecting on the day’s events.]
Phoebe: Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to
know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up
at us and smiling right now.
Ross: Looking up?
Phoebe: Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for
sure.
Monica: Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna
be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck
confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Ross: Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the
recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Phoebe: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk
to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th,
2032.
Ross: That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got
shuffleboard that day.
Phoebe: That’s what you think.
Monica: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s?
Wouldn’t they have the recipe?
Phoebe: Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My
grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Monica: What was her name?
Phoebe: Nesele Toulouse.
Monica: Nestle Tollhouse?!
Phoebe: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Monica: (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this
the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
Phoebe: (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
Monica: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure
out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Phoebe: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)
you’re burning in hell!!
[Scene: The Gym, Chandler and Mr. Geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]
Chandler: So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you
didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a
little embarrassed about it.
Mr. Geller: I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than
embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating
Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I
was a lawyer.
Chandler: What did you do when they found out?
Mr. Geller: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod
along. Shall we? 
(Chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their robes. Only
Chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. You see this is a coed whirlpool, which
means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and Chandler didn’t
seem to wear his. Needless to say, everyone is shocked, including Chandler.)
Chandler: So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Ending Credits
[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; Joey and Rachel are relaxing.]
Rachel: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)
Rachel: Ohh we’re not sailing.
Joey: Just pull on it.
Rachel: All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)
Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
Joey: What else?
Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.
Joey: Thank you.
Rachel: Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the
stuff falls out.)
Joey: What are you doing?
Rachel: Ohh, sorry.
Joey: What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all
the good stuff fall out.
(More falls out.)
Rachel: Ohh whoops.
Joey: Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I’m my
dad!
EndRachel: Joey!
Joey: Oh, you weren’t finished?
Rachel: Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica
and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my
office!
Joey: Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish
mine.
Rachel: It’s the same story.
Joey: (groans in disgust) Wow, it’s really long.
Rachel: (ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so
happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Monica: Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Rachel: Yeah!
Monica: I’m so happy for you!
Joey: Well, these really are the days of our lives.
Monica: What?!
Joey: Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh God!
Rachel: I got—I get a big pay raise!
Phoebe: Oh hey!
Joey: I’ll be playing Drake Remoray’s twin brother, Stryker!
Monica: Oooh!
Rachel: I get to hire my own assistant!

Monica and Phoebe: Ahhh!!
Joey: (jumps up) Well—I got a head rush from standing up to fast right
there.
[Scene: Rachel’s New Office, she’s interviewing a potential new assistant,
Hilda.]
Rachel: (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
Hilda: That’s right.
Rachel: Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last
question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
Hilda: What?
Rachel: I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had
anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this
is-this isn’t the same thing. 
Hilda: No dear. It’s not.
Rachel: No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming
in it was nice to meet you.
Hilda: Thank you! Good meeting you.
Rachel: All right. (Hilda exits) I’m a total pro!
(There’s a knock on the door and a handsome man enters.)
Man: Hello?
Rachel: (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are
actually down the hall.
Man: Actually, I’m here about the assistant job.
Rachel: Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a
seat there. Umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?
Man: Tag Jones.
Rachel: Uh-huh, go on.
Tag: That’s it. That’s my whole name.
Rachel: That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well
let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)
Tag: I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t
have a lot of experience, but uh…
Rachel: Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years
painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!
Tag: It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to
learn…
Rachel: Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and
takes his picture.) I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it.
Could you just stand up please?
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in
and sits in their easy chair.]
Chandler: No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to
each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
Phoebe: (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Monica: (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.
Chandler: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Monica: I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
Chandler: Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between
one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Monica: Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.
Chandler: No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do
not have any secrets from you.
Monica: Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior
year at Disneyland?
Chandler: Oh no-no, I can’t do that.
Monica: If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this
restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of
his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and
Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Monica: Oh my God. He threw up?
Chandler: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs
hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?
Monica: Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting
fired.
Chandler: That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Monica: That’s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]
Rachel: Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Chandler: (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell
her I am sick!
Rachel: No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean
I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot
of experience and then there’s this guy…
Chandler: What about him?
Rachel: I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to
do. Tell me what to do.
Phoebe: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire
an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.
Rachel: Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot
of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!
Phoebe: Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No!
You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. Umm,
this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
Rachel: Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect
for the job Hilda!
Chandler: Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!
Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
[Scene: The Days of Our Lives producer’s office, Joey is entering to find
Terry there.]
Terry: Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Joey: Hey Terry!
Terry: Good to see you again!
Joey: It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller
then they used to.
Terry: It’s a different building.
Joey: So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Terry: Why don’t we start right now!
Joey: Okay.
Terry: Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)
Joey: (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna
offer me the part.
Terry: Why would you think that?
Joey: Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who
looks more me than me right?
Terry: Everybody has to audition.
Joey: Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my
own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.
Terry: I’m sorry Joey that’s…that’s the way it is.
Joey: Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up
here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?
Well y’know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who’s hoop…
This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
[Scene: Rachel’s office, she’s there as Tag knocks on the door and enters
carrying a plant.]
Rachel: Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Tag: I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face
yesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring
you your first… (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office.
Rachel: Kinda.
Tag: Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
(Sets the plant down on her desk.)
Rachel: Oh-ohh, thank you.
Tag: Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody.
Rachel: Well…
Tag: Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel: But I hired you!
Tag: What?
Rachel: Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!
Tag: I am?!
Rachel: Yeah!
Tag: I can’t believe it!
Rachel: Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs
and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is setting the table for dinner as
Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Hey! Good, you’re home!
Chandler: Oh it’s always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You
again!"
Monica: Hey baby. (Kisses him.)
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: I made you a surprise.
Chandler: Oh yeah?
Monica: Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a
craving for them.
Chandler: Did you not understand the story?
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey! What’s up?
Monica: Ross!
Ross: Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do
for dinner.
Chandler: Huh.
Ross: (notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner
stuff? You making dinner?
Chandler: No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
Ross: What you got over there? Tacos?
Monica: No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef
smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)
Ross: Uhh, those are tacos.
Monica: Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Ross: Eh, either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t
eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)
What’s so funny?!
Monica: (trying not to laugh) I’m not laughing. 
(Ross and Chandler move closer to her and she starts laughing again.)
Ross: (To Chandler) You told her!
Chandler: Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the
shoulder.)
Ross: (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I
choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, "Umm, what would
make this ride more fun?!"
Monica: You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be
laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler
laughing.)
Ross: (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
Chandler: I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples
can’t keep secrets from one another!
Ross: Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Chandler: Du-ude!
Monica: (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
Ross: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…
Chandler: Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Ross: And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes
over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what
you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes
out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes
to bars and makes out with…girls.
Monica: (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Chandler: In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Ross: Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…
Chandler: Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Ross: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Commercial Break
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is giving Joey a massage as Rachel enters.]
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey—Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out?
Rachel: Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Joey: Was she happy you gave her the job?
Rachel: Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
(The phone rings and Joey answers it.)
Joey: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To
Phoebe and Rachel) It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me
for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next
week’s script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like they’re taking it off the
air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) We’re not even
shootin’ them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E!
Phoebe: Sorry.
Rachel: I’m sorry Joey.
Joey: Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
(Phoebe and Rachel both pause, look at each other, and go press their breasts against
him. Which Joey doesn’t mind, of course.)
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are still giving
away all of their secrets.]
Chandler: You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg
warmers!
Ross: All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest
and won!
Chandler: Ross came in forth and cried!
Monica: Oh my God! (Laughing)
Ross: Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler
should know some of your secrets too!
Monica: I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
Ross: Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni
off a jewelry box she’d made.
Monica: Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden
Girls!
Ross: Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
Monica: It’s hard for some people!
Chandler: (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow—whoa!
Monica: Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Chandler: Hey!!!
Monica: Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!
Ross: Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who
cleaned our dorm!
Chandler: That was you!
Ross: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is still bumming about cancellation of Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E.]
Joey: How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today,
I got nothin’!
Rachel: Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Joey: Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Phoebe: What happened?
Joey: Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Rachel: Joey, why would you do that?
Joey: Because they wanted me to audition!
Phoebe: You! An actor?! That’s madness!
[Scene: Rachel’s Outer Office, Tag is sitting at his desk as Rachel walks up. She
stops and watches him pick up the phone.]
Tag: Rachel Green’s office. (Hangs up.)
Rachel: Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?
Tag: (shyly) Nobody. I was just practicing.
Rachel: Really? (Giggles.)
(Phoebe rounds the corner.)
Phoebe: Hi!
Tag: Hi! Rachel Green’s office.
Phoebe: You must be Hilda.
Rachel: Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a
second? (Goes into office.)
Tag: Phoebe! That’s a great name.
Phoebe: Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Rachel: (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We’ll be right back. (They go into her
office and she closes the door.)
Phoebe: So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Rachel: All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling
you…
Phoebe: But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Rachel: Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably
not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this
moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes? 
(Kathy enters (Because she’s listed in the credits).)
Kathy: Hey Rachel!
Rachel: Hi!
Kathy: Cute assistant! What’s his story? Is he…
Rachel: Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
[Scene: Terry’s office, Joey has come to beg for a second chance.]
Joey: Hey! Terry.
Terry: Joey Tribbiani! I’m surprised your big head could fit through our
small halls! (Gets up) I gotta go Joey.
Joey: Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really
sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You
gotta give me another chance.
Terry: I can’t help you Joey.
Joey: Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no
idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
[Cut to a hospital room set on the Days of Our Lives stage. Two nurses are
standing next to a bed with a man whose face is completely covered in bandages and reading
his chart.]
Nurse #1: This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s
hopeless.
Nurse #2: It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray’s a miracle worker.
Look, here he comes.
(Stryker enters, only it’s not Joey playing him.)
Dr. Stryker Remoray: Good morning. (He walks over to the bed, leans down, and
whispers to him.) Drake, it’s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?

The Director: And cut!
Joey: (jumping up and removing the bandages) I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are sitting there and not talking to
each other.]
Monica: Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and
very little glue.
Ross: And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Chandler: (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
Monica: No!
Chandler: Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
Monica: I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are
you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)
Chandler: Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that
we should share everything and not have any secrets? 
Monica: Yeah?
Chandler: Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
Monica: Ohh, absolutely.
Ross: And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from
everybody else.
Monica: Yeah, definitely!
Ross: Okay, (gets up) if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out
with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
Monica: Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.
Ross: Man! (Monica mouths, "I’m sorry.")
Chandler: Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out
with…all the guys in my office.
(Ross storms out.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Rachel’s office, she’s looking at a picture of Tag when he knocks and
enters.]
Rachel: (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
Tag: Do you have a minute?
Rachel: Well yeah, sure, what’s up?
Tag: I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.
Rachel: Oh really?!
Tag: Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Rachel: Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Tag: But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I
was gay.
Rachel: Why’s that?
Tag: I don’t think I should say.
Rachel: Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you
can’t tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)
Tag: Okay.
Rachel: ‘Kay.
Tag: Well…
Rachel: Yeah.
Tag: I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Rachel: (Pause) Yeah, she’s gay.
EndMonica: Yeah that’s right.

Woman: (sarcastically) Huh, good luck!
Phoebe: Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are finishing watching Die Hard
on video.]
Chandler: Die Hard still great!
Joey: Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Chandler: What’d you rent?
Joey: Die Hard 2.
Chandler: (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Joey: Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Ross: Joey, we just saw it!
Joey: And?
Ross: And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!

Joey and Ross: Die Hard!!!!!!
Ross: Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Chandler: Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Ross: Well, John McLane had plans!
Chandler: No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all
worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Joey: What are you talking about? Bitch.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is bringing Rachel some coffee.]
Phoebe: Hey Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah?
Phoebe: Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Rachel: Really?!
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m
your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
Phoebe: Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…
Rachel: Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
Phoebe: But why does it even matter?!
Rachel: Why does it matter so much to you?!
Phoebe: Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best
friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!
Rachel: What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
Phoebe: (gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to
do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve
done it at least twice!
Rachel: Yeah but Phoebe…
Phoebe: And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I
guess that was it.
Rachel: Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you
can be Monica’s made of honor.
Phoebe: Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
Rachel: I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
Phoebe: Oh I know.
Rachel: Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what
isn’t?")
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I don’t think Joey and
Ross know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And they’re on the same couch.
Which means they’re sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the
other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasn’t
been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that
there’s anything wrong with that. That is unless you’re a Republican in which
that kind of thing will bring about the downfall of Western society, especially if they
should happen to want to get married. Anyway, let me recap. No, there is too much, let me
sum up. Ross and Joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at
the same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]
Ross: What happened?!!
Joey: Well, I don’t know!!
Ross: We fell asleep! That is all.
Joey: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.
Ross: I think that would be best.
Joey: Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.
Ross: Okay. But not about this!
Joey: No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross’s hand.) Bye.
Ross: No touch! No touch!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just gotten back from brunch and is
telling Chandler about it.]
Monica: Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman
overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.
Chandler: That’s sweet.
Monica: No, it’s more like a (sarcastically) good luck.
Chandler: So uh, what did this woman look like?
Monica: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Chandler: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing
called a mirror?
Monica: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Chandler: No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not
attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He
gets up and grabs a photo album.
Monica: What are you doing?
Chandler: Well, let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is
that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
Monica: Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Chandler: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Monica: Did you break up with her?
Chandler: (pause) No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two
summers, and then I broke up with her.
Monica: Why?
Chandler: Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten
really fa-aa-aw-ow…
Monica: Fat?!
Chandler: I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
Monica: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Chandler: Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still
feel bad?
Monica: Well, apparently she does.
Chandler: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not
amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Rachel and Phoebe are already there.]
Joey: Hey! What’s going on?
Rachel: Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
Joey: Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that
girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)
Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe: See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
Rachel: All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
Phoebe: Na-uh, I am!
Rachel: How come you are?!
Phoebe: Because I cared enough to lie!
Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could
have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type
situations.
Phoebe: What are you talking about?
Joey: Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of
the people they see, they give me the part.
Phoebe: Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Joey: Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding.
Rachel: Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!
Phoebe: No! Coins hate me!
Rachel: Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Phoebe: Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. 
Joey: Hi.
Ross: Just uh, brought back your videos.
Joey: Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Ross: No! No we don’t!
Joey: Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! 
Ross: I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
Joey: Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Ross: I’ve had better.
Joey: Okay! When?!
Ross: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Joey: Uh-huh!
Ross: I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
Joey: I want to do it again.
Ross: We can’t do it again.
Joey: Why not?
Ross: Because it’s weird!
Joey: Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Ross: Sure, what do you got?
Joey: Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is approaching the bathroom door behind
which Chandler is using the facility.]
Monica: Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you
are!
Chandler: Can you figure out what I’m doing?
Monica: You’re Lewis Posin.
Chandler: Who?
Monica: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day
I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Chandler: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the
bathroom?!
Monica: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges,
without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as
I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Chandler: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica: No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis
apologized to me.
Chandler: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better
person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are laying out the ground rules for the maid
of honor auditions to Rachel and Phoebe.]
Joey: Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna
give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to
10, 1 being the highest.
Ross: No, 10 is the highest.
Joey: Why is 10 the highest?
Ross: Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel
you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You’re with
Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the
part of Monica.)
Joey: (crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!
Rachel: Okay, uh…
Joey: I’ve got cold feet.
Rachel: …it’s gonna be okay!
Joey: No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it!
This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!
Rachel: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know,
it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember
that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the
gifts.
Joey: (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I
like that!
Rachel: Thanks!
Ross: Yes, very nice Rachel.
Rachel: Thank you judges.
Phoebe: Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Rachel: Oh!
Joey: Okay, Phoebe…
Phoebe: Yes! Your honor?
Joey: We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do"
when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Ross: (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember
that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Phoebe: Oh!
Joey: Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Phoebe: Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Ross: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Rachel: Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…
Ross: Go!
Rachel: Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage
as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind!
Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a
couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he
seemed like a six year old.

Ross and Joey: Oh! That’s nice.
Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and
I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are
truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds
it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon
together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Joey: Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
Ross: Yeah, it really was!
Rachel: Aw, thanks!
Ross: Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really
don’t see the point.
Joey: Yeah.
Phoebe: Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
(Raises her glass and drinks.)
(Joey and Ross pause while they picture the event.)
Joey: And she’s back in the game.
[Scene: A random apartment building, Chandler and Monica are knocking on the door of
the woman from the beginning.]
Chandler: (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember
me.
Julie: Hello Skidmark.
Chandler: (To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.
Monica: It’s pretty clear.
Chandler: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken
up with you because you were overweight.
Julie: That’s why you broke up with me?
Chandler: You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I
guess my work here is done!
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are giving Phoebe and Rachel the results of their
election. Somewhat faster than Florida I might add.]
Joey: All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed
very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that
in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!
Phoebe: Really?! I won!
Rachel: What?!
Ross: I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Rachel: Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard that
before.)
Ross: Actually, it wasn’t that close.
Rachel: No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was
ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the
coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
Phoebe: The coins have finally forgiven me!
Rachel: Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her,
her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
Phoebe: (running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)
You guys are the best!
Joey: Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Ross: Yeah?
Joey: Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on
my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.) 
Ross: Why-why would I care about that?
Joey: No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll
be. 
(Joey gets up and heads for the door. After a pause Ross decides to join him.)
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica have returned from
Julie’s.]
Chandler: As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m
going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Monica: Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t
have to apologize.
Chandler: I would really love it if could do both.
Monica: All right, I…I have to ask.
Chandler: What?
Monica: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Chandler: What?!
Monica: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have
gained?
Chandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Monica: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not
the point.
Chandler: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I
was 15!
Monica: Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember
when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Chandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica: How?
Chandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica: What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different.
I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!
Chandler: Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin,
beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize
for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. 
Monica: Keep going.
Chandler: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love
you.
Monica: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Chandler: I’d carry you around in my pocket.
Monica: I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
Chandler: Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters carrying a shopping bag.]
Rachel: Hi Pheebs.
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
Phoebe: That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at
her.) Oh, you mean today.
Rachel: Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know
I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to
be yours.
Phoebe: Oh yeah!
Rachel: Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started
putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…
Phoebe: Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
Rachel: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this
is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows
Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder
Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse)
Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Phoebe: Ohh.
Rachel: And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at
weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.
Phoebe: This stuff is great!
Rachel: Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was
saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s
blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…
Phoebe: Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made
of honor.
Rachel: You do? Why?
Phoebe: Because I think it means more to you.
Rachel: But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.
Phoebe: Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about
since you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)
Rachel: No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Phoebe: (looking at the picture again) Man alive!
Monica: (entering) Hey, what’s going on?
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Monica: (gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We
really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should
probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll
get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! (Runs out
leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)
Rachel: Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets
suddenly scared.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are napping together again and both wake up at
the same time.]
Joey: Great nap.
Ross: It really was.
(Suddenly Rachel clears her throat and the camera cuts to the rest of the gang staring
at them. Needless to say Joey and Ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the
gang.)
Joey: (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)
Ross: (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
EndRachel: Hi.

Joey’s Date: Sorry about that, but I couldn’t get that lock to work on
the door.
Rachel: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.

Joey’s Date: You must be Rachel, I’m Erin.
Rachel: Hi.
Erin: Hi. I don’t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say
anything about me?
Rachel: (pause) Would you like some pancakes?
Opening Credits
[Scene: N.Y.U’s University Library, Ross is entering with Chandler.]
Chandler: …Come on! Why are we here?!
Ross: Okay, okay take a guess.
(An old woman pushes a cart full of books past.)
Chandler: The hot chicks?
Ross: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,
y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral
dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the
biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded
section behind the racks.)
Chandler: Wow that’s actually pretty cool.
Ross: (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named
Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next
aisle.) What is that?
Chandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
(They go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds
do in secluded corners of university libraries. For those of you who don’t know what
I’m talking about, let’s just say that clothing is undone. Ross gasps and the
couple gets up and runs away.)
Female Student: (as they are moving past Ross) I’m so sorry!
Male Student: Sorry!
Chandler: You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?
[Scene: Monica’s Restaurant Kitchen, Monica is cooking as a waitress enters
carrying a plate of food that has been sent back.]
Monica: She sent the chicken back again?!
The Waitress: She says it’s to dry now and she wants to come back here and
explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
(The waitress lets her in as Monica is about to throw a lobster into a pot of boiling
water (Although, she hasn’t taken off the rubber bands that hold the claws, so she
can’t be that good of a chef). Anyway, guess who the Colonel is by the
following phrase.)

The Colonel: OH…MY…GAWD!!!! (Yep, it’s Janice.)
Monica: (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around
to face the planet’s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of
course. She’s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.
Janice: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the
best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)
Monica: I’m fine.
Janice: (notices Monica’s engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your
finger?! I’m blind!
Monica: Oh… Uh…
Janice: So, who’s the lucky guy?
[Cut to Monica and Chandler’s just after Monica has finished telling Chandler what
happened.]
Chandler: OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You
didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?
Monica: Well, she saw the ring.
Chandler: Did she freak out?
Monica: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most
people.
Chandler: Right.
Monica: Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh,
she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Chandler: (laughs) You said no right?
Monica: Huh?
Chandler: You said no right?!
Monica: Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what
was I supposed to do?!
Chandler: Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby
is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!
Monica: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.
Chandler: What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You
don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s
gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Monica: Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is
she?!
Chandler: Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what?
She’s probably not gonna even want to come.
Monica: Really?
Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Monica: So-so you would’ve just lied?
Chandler: Yes!!
Monica: Would it really have been that easy?
Chandler: Yes!!!
Monica: Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with
her and Clark.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is coming back from work to find Phoebe, Rachel, and
someone else with her back turned is there.]
Joey: Hey! What’s up?

Phoebe and Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey-hey, who’s your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,
startling him) Hey!!
Erin: Hey Joey!
Joey: Erin! Still here!
Rachel: Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Joey: Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.
Erin: Ohh, listen. I’ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Rachel: I know!
Phoebe: Okay!
Erin: Bye Joey. (Kisses him.) Last night was fun.
Joey: Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya.
Rachel: Oh and I’ll call ya too!
Erin: Or I’ll call you!
Phoebe: And call me!
Joey: (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.
Erin: Bye.
Joey: Bye-bye.
Rachel: Bye!
(Joey closes the door behind her.) 
Joey: So, system kinda broke down huh?!
Rachel: Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things
you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…
Phoebe: We want you to marry her!
Joey: What?!!
Phoebe: She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Joey: No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Rachel: Cupid.
Phoebe: Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.
Joey: Man, do you know what guys want!
Rachel: Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s
sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Joey: My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good
time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.
Phoebe: Yeah, but you always say that.
Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Joey: Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.
Phoebe: Whatever.
Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)
Joey: Hey, don’t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You’re the one
who’s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you’re the one
having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Rachel: Phoebe!
Phoebe: Secret affair!
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Joey are there as Ross enters.]
Ross: People are doing it in front of my book!
Rachel: I’m sorry?
Ross: My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,
and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology
section!
Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on
campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Rachel: Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where
all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was.
Ross: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!
Joey: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Ross: Oh for cryin’ out loud! (He storms out.)
Joey: All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Rachel: Well now what’s the rush?
Joey: I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.
Phoebe: (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
Rachel: Well look who’s here!
Erin: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Erin: Joey.
Joey: Erin.
Erin: Hey Rachel.
Rachel: Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Erin: What’s wrong?
Rachel: Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Phoebe: Oh no.
Joey: (skeptical) What party?

Phoebe and Rachel: A birthday party.
Joey: Who’s birthday party?

Phoebe and Rachel: Allison’s birthday party.
Joey: (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?

Phoebe and Rachel: 32. (Joey’s not buying it.)
Rachel: (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do
something?!
Joey: (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.
Commercial Break
[Scene: The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on
duty.]
Ross: Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology
section, fifth floor, stack 437?
The Librarian: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.
Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian
brings his boss over.)
The Head Librarian: How can I help you?
Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the
Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people
are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
The Head Librarian: We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns
to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the
library is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you.
Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of
the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to
do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are doing dishes as Joey enters.]
Joey: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: How did it go with Erin?
Joey: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Phoebe: Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?
Joey: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the
first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Phoebe: Didn’t you sleep together?
Joey: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves
sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever
to have kids, well that’s a…
Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my
Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don’t get married before I do.
Joey: Okay.
[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are on their date with Janice and Clark,
however Clark is a no show and Janice is crying the Mississippi River about it.]
Janice: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Monica: He might still show up.
Janice: Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.
Monica: Is that all?
Janice: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you
tell about your lovely wedding?
Chandler: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the
wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure
why we’re having it.
Monica: It’s actually going to be just family.
Janice: Oh…wait…you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you
something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In
Red?
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is entering and arguing baseball with Erin. Phoebe and
Rachel are already there.]
Joey: How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Erin: What about Benitez?
Joey: What about Game 1 of the Series?
Erin: What about shut up?
Joey: You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
I’ll be right back. 
Erin: Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)
Rachel: So how’s it goin’ with Joey?
Erin: Uh, okay.
Rachel: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me
that you like him.
Erin: Look, he’s a really great guy and I know that you really want
this to work out, but I just don’t see this having a future.
Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just
change your mind?!
Erin: Kinda.
Phoebe: Then change it back!
Erin: I’m sorry I… It’s just there’s no real spark.
Phoebe: No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?
Erin: Yeah.
Rachel: Ugh, tramp!
Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?
Erin: I really don’t think he does. And y’know what? Maybe you guys
could help clue him in. Y’know, tell him I’m-I’m not interested in a
serious relationship or something.
Phoebe: Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.
Erin: Yeah! That would be great!
Phoebe: Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian,
and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t need
everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)
Erin: I’m sorry?
Phoebe: Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.
Joey: (returning) Hey! You wanna go?
Erin: Yeah, let’s go.
Joey: Okay. See you guys later.
Erin: Bye guys.
Rachel: Yeah, see ya.
Joey: (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)
Rachel: Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Phoebe: No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
[Scene: The library’s Paleontology section, Ross is patrolling as a couple walks
up.]
Ross: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Guy: Yeah, we were…we were just looking around.
Ross: Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you
looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester
Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Guy: Uhh….
Ross: Ah… Ah…Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts
looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the
section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views
on evolution?
Woman: Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
Ross: I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
Woman: I’m sorry, who are you?
Ross: I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller.
Woman: Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh—Wait! (Grabs his
book off of the shelf.) Did you write this?
Ross: Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
Woman: Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought.
You’re…you’re so young.
Ross: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
[Time Lapse, Ross and the woman are now in a state of partial undress and are standing
in front of the head librarian with two security guards watching them.]
Ross: I am very…very sorry.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are watching TV as Joey enters.]
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: So how was, how was your date?
Joey: Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this
ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m
thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Phoebe: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Joey: No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky
thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.

Phoebe and Rachel: Oh no, yeah.
Rachel: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the
feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
Joey: Where are you gettin’ this?
Rachel: Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.
Joey: Oh. Oh.
Rachel: Joey…
Joey: No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! (Heads
for his room.) Right?
Phoebe: Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her.
Rachel: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and
tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.
Joey: No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Rachel: Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
Joey: Yeah?
Rachel: Do you want some pancakes?
Joey: (coming back out) Finally!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen
table and are still trying to decide what to do about Janice.]
Monica: What are we gonna do?
Chandler: I say we go with Careless Whisper.
(There’s a knock on the door and Janice enters.)
Janice: Chandler?
Chandler: (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Janice: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I
just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door
behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was
wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with
family.
Monica: (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?
Janice: Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I
might do.
Chandler: Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
Janice: (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?
Monica: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Janice: Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)
Monica: We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.
Chandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Monica: Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Chandler: Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
Monica: I never stop thinking about it.
Janice: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I
take my bath.
Chandler: Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.
Janice: Why not?
Chandler: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
(And she does the laugh.)
Janice: Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have a
hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you
have a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear
that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)
(Chandler does the same nasal sound to Chandler.)
Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Janice: Why?
Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Janice: He does?
Chandler: Say again?
Monica: That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t
stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.
Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.
Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you
can.
Janice: Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go. (Starts
for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: The library’s Paleontology section, Ross is on patrol and stops a security
guard through the stack of books.]
Ross: (to the guard) Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in
people’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay, see you later. 
(Ross resumes his patrol when his best friend and sister walk up and start to take off
their coats, but they stop when they see him.)
Chandler: I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
EndRoss: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? 
Chandler: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all
the states in six minutes. 
Ross: What? That's like insanely easy! 
Chandler: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least
one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica). 
Monica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so
technically I didn't lose. 
Ross: What? You forgot fourteen states? 
Monica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That’s true in so many ways, trust
me, I’ve lived in one and been to the other.)
[Chandler's watch beeps] 
Chandler: Oh, okay, time's up! 
Rachel: All right, I got 48. 
Chandler: Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? 
Phoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of
celery, and I have one: regular celery. 
Chandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables,
Joey? 
Joey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. 
Ross: Wow, how many have you got? 
Joey: Fifty-six! 
Opening Credits
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross is sitting in the couch doing Chandler's
game. Chandler is sitting in his barca-lounger. The girls are in the kitchen.]
Joey: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 
Chandler: Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)
There you go. 
[Cut to the girls in the kitchen.]
Rachel: (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting? 
Monica: 'Cause you invited your assistant. 
Rachel: Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,
so he's spending Thanksgiving with her. 
Monica: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato
stuffed pumpkin. 
Rachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so
delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. 
Monica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but
I still do.
Phoebe: Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have
that. (She gets up and heads for her room) 
Ross: Done! With time a-to-spare. 
Chandler: Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up
Ross' pad) 
Ross: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a
group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map,
or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? 
Chandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad) 
Ross: What? That's impossible. 
Joey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? 
Monica: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please,
watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! 
Chandler: I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up! 
Ross: No, just give me another minute. 
Chandler: Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,
okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. 
Ross: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50
before dinner. 
Chandler: Okay, but if you can't…no dinner! 
Ross: You're on! 
Joey: (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on
there that you don't have. 
Monica: (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven
doesn't work? 
Joey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 
Monica: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? 
Ross: Pshhshhh!
Monica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket) 
Chandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe
in your apartment. 
Joey: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. 
[Chandler and Monica head out with some stuff. Phoebe comes out of her room with a
bag.] 
Phoebe: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
Ross: Phoebe, why is your bag moving? 
Phoebe: Oh, it's not! 
Rachel: Seriously, it's moving! 
Joey: What the hell is in there? 
Phoebe: It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's
bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. 
[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Chandler enter.] 
Monica: Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more
often? 
Chandler: I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like
old pumpkins or something. 
Monica: That's my pie! 
Chandler: Which smells delicious! 
Monica: Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
Chandler: What? 
Monica: We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks
out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! 
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Ross is still doing his list. Rachel and Joey
are feeding the dog as the phone rings.]
Phoebe: (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Monica: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? 
Phoebe: I'm sorry, who's this? 
Monica: Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
Chandler: Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! 
Phoebe: No, there's no dog here? 
Monica: Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s
apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand. 
Phoebe: Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
Monica: I'll be right there! 
Phoebe: (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're
here already? How are they doing this? 
Rachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here? 
Tag: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still
good. 
Rachel: Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your
girlfriend? 
Tag: We kinda broke up this morning. 
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. 
Tag: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ross: Ohio!! Thank you! 
[Time lapse, Chandler and Monica enter.]
Chandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!
Ross: What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
Joey: Yeah that dog left! 
Monica: (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! 
Phoebe: There's no dog in here. 
[The dog barks.] 
Chandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! 
Phoebe: No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the
dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I
have a dog in my room. 
Chandler: What is it doing here? 
Phoebe: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She
bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.
May I please stay with you nice people?
Monica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! 
Chandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5
minutes, my throat will just close up! 
Phoebe: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
Chandler: (gasping) Really? 
Monica: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a
reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 
Chandler: Well, it still has to go, right?

Monica and Phoebe: Why? 
Chandler: Okay, it's um…
Joey: (interrupting him) Don't do it! 
Monica: Don't do what? 
Chandler: (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,
"Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs. 
All: What? 
Phoebe: Are you crazy? 
Ross: Are you out of your mind?
Phoebe: Why? 
Joey: Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
Chandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are
thinking, and that scares me a little bit. 
Ross: Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat
out of my hand!!!
Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? 
Chandler: (scared) Is there a puppy here? 
Tag: You don't like puppies? 
Chandler: (to Tag) Okay, you are new!
Joey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's
like Ross not likin’ ice cream. 
Phoebe: You don't like ice cream? 
Ross: It's too cold. 
Chandler: Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 
Ross: (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
Chandler: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I
don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An
awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
[Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]
Ross: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.

Monica: 1250.
Ross: Damn, I forgot you were here. 
Phoebe: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a
minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
Rachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? 
Monica: Yeah. 
Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move? 
Phoebe: Oh, I'd say about a month. 
Monica: Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
Joey: Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
Rachel: Interesting. 
Monica: When it's your assistant, I would say never. 
Joey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because
if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. 
Rachel: Huh. A moo-point? 
Joey: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. 
Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did
that all just make sense?
Monica: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s
obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. 
Rachel: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. 
Joey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is
this pretty, no one cares what's inside. 
[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]
Rachel: Hey! 
Tag: Hey. 
Rachel: How are you holding up? 
Tag: Not bad. 
Rachel: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
Tag: Thanks. 
Rachel: So were you guys together a long time? 
Tag: A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. 
Rachel: Now that she broke up with you? 
Tag: Yeah. 
Rachel: Yeah. Hmmmm. 
Tag: It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in
love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do
you ever have that feeling? 
Rachel: No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know
that I figure it…it has to work out. 
Tag: Why? 
Rachel: Because, uh—it has to. 
Tag: You have all the answers, don't you? 
Rachel: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. 
Tag: Hey, thanks for talking to me. 
Rachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug) 
Joey: (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you
should go for it! 
Tag: What? 
Joey: (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel
moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)

Tag: What did Joey say? I like you back? 
Rachel: Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure
about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,
yeah!
Tag: Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. 
Rachel: No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what
he said, because um, I'm attracted to you. 
Tag: Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.) 
Rachel: Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's
crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I
want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be
really great if you said something right about now. 
Tag: (looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He
points down to the street) 
Rachel: What? 
Tag: Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!! 
Rachel: Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you
wanna get off your chest? 
Tag: I can't believe this! (He walks back in again) 
Rachel: (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and
they’re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh
look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too) 
[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Phoebe sitting on the floor next to Clunkers
basket.]
Monica: Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now. 
Phoebe: (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. 
Monica: Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Phoebe: Yeah, okay. 
[They both get up and head for the door. Clunkers whines a little] 
Monica: Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to
Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her! 
Phoebe: You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't
even know. 
Monica: That's not gonna work. 
Phoebe: I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's
not so smart. 
Monica: Hey! I didn't know either. 
Phoebe: Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? 
Monica: Yeah, I knew. 
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross lays a lot off small papers, shaped like
the U.S. states onto the floor making a map with the states. Phoebe enters]
Phoebe: Where's Chandler? 
Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am. 
Phoebe: Wash your hands!!!
Chandler: How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom) 
[Phoebe waves Monica in. Monica sneaks in with the bag with Clunkers in it and heads
for Phoebe's room.] 
Ross: Hey! What's she doing back here? 
Monica: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! 
Ross: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... 
Phoebe: (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.
Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. 
Ross: Yeah, but, but look what I'm... 
Phoebe: See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her
room) 
Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica? 
Ross: Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. 
Chandler: Why not? 
(We can hear the dog whining at a high pitch.)
Ross: Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
Chandler: Well, I, I should go in there. 
Ross: No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. 
Chandler: Why not? 
Ross: Because you sent away the dog!
Chandler: This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom) 
Ross: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog
named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her
friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him.
Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. 
Joey: (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that
Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter? 
Chandler: Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. 
Joey: So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
Chandler: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,
w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
Joey: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Chandler: And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out) 
Joey: Ross, you need some help? 
Ross: From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)
Yes, please! 
Joey: (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make
stuff up!
[Time lapse, Ross still laying a lot out the states.]
Ross: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. 
[Joey stands up again. Rachel enters the door] 
Joey: Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. 
Rachel: Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I
have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I
freaked him out 
Joey: If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. 
[Rachel walks past Joey towards the couch] 
Phoebe: (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here? 
Chandler: No, no he went for a walk. 
Phoebe: Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! 
[The dog barks, runs out of Phoebe's room and jumps onto the couch] 
Rachel: (gasps) Hi! 
Joey: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!

Phoebe: Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! 
Joey: You think? 
[The door opens and Chandler comes in. Rachel covers the door with a blanket] 
Monica: Hi, honey. 
Chandler: Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 
Monica: What? Why, why would... 
Phoebe: (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we
won't. 
Chandler: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.
Y’know, for you, and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have
gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof,
which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so,
so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then
over to the street) 
Phoebe: We have good news, look whose back! 
Rachel: (uncovers the dog) Hi! 
Chandler: Clunkers?! Oh my god! 
Monica: That's right, she came back all by herself. 
Phoebe: It's a Thanksgiving miracle! 
Chandler: (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you! 
Phoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she
must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with
her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts to
not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? 
[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]
Ross: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell
you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able
to eat something. 
Chandler: It's up to you. 
[Ross whines and starts working again. The door opens and Tag enters.] 
Rachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing? 
Tag: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. 
Rachel: Oh. 
Tag: Thanks for having me over, you guys. 
Ross: Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get
the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? 
Tag: Colorado. 
Ross: Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.) 
[Rachel and Tag go into the hall.] 
Rachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. 
Tag: Okay. 
Rachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It
just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever
happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never
talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? 
Tag: Um, I'm not. 
Rachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. 
Tag: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that
nothing could ever happen between us. 
Rachel: Really? 
Tag: Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her) 
Rachel: Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. 
Ending Credits 
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, later that night, there is someone knocking on
the door and Chandler stumbles out into the living room, turns on the light, looks through
the peephole, and opens the door.]
Ross: Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
Chandler: All right. 
Ross: (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now! 
Chandler: You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out
of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice. 
Ross: (pauses) I know. 
Chandler: Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
End(Monica opens the door.) 
Gary: Hi!
Monica: Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Gary: It’s candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops
of heaven.
Monica: Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Chandler: (laughs) 4:00 A.M.
Gary: So, can I get some candy?
Chandler: I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!
(Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
Monica: Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the
morning.
Gary: Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building? 
Monica: Um-hmm.
Gary: (looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you!
Chandler: Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.)
[Scene: Rachel’s Office, she’s slinking out to where Tag works and checks to
make sure no one is coming.]
Rachel: (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
Tag: No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Rachel: (worried) Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a
joke for you!
Tag: A joke they would appreciate?
Rachel: I’m thinkin’ no.
Tag: What did you say?!
Rachel: Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like
your tiney-tiny touchie.
Tag: No, not my touchie.
Rachel: Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,
"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems
with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a
little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Monica, Ross, and Chandler are watching Phoebe polish the
daisies on her bike outside.]
Monica: Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the
story, I almost cried.
Joey: Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Chandler: Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Joey: (about to cry) Those two only had each other!
Ross: Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Monica: Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She
had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Joey: Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.
Ross: Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
[Cut to outside, they’re going to talk to Phoebe about walking the bike.]
Joey: Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe: Oh hi!
Chandler: Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Phoebe: Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Ross: Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?
Phoebe: Of course!
Monica: Umm, can we see you ride it?
Phoebe: Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,
gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is making candy while Chandler and
Rachel are taste testing and Joey is on the couch doodling.]
Monica: See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And
here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you
hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Chandler: (with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy.
Rachel: Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they
didn’t take it the way I meant it.
Chandler: Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good
worker.
Rachel: Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Joey: Hey Rach?
Rachel: Yeah?
Joey: That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like
this? (He shows her what he’s been drawing.)
Rachel: Oh my God! Joey!
Chandler: What is the matter with you?
Rachel: Ugh!
Joey: Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford
porn.
(There is a knock on the door and Monica answers it. There is a woman standing there.)
The Woman: Hi! I’m sorry, I know it’s after hours but I really need
candy.
Monica: I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? (Points to her new sign.)
Rules are rules.
The Woman: Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them
all about your candy!
Monica: No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?
The Woman: I told ‘em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Monica: Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but
whatever.
The Woman: Please, can’t you help me out?
Joey: (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Chandler: Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really
loud?
Monica: (still talking to the woman) All right, I’ll do it just this once!
But you can’t tell anybody!
The Woman: (exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!

Joey and Chandler: Yeah, that’s her.
The Woman: (after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.
Monica: (closing the door) It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that
sign didn’t work!
Chandler: Y’know what would work?
Monica: Hmm?
Chandler: Stop making candy!
Monica: But they like it!
Chandler: You mean they like you.
Monica: Maybe.
Chandler: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Monica: Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny
man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
[Scene: Central Park, Ross is teaching Phoebe how to ride her bike.]
Ross: Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine.
Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…
Phoebe: (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,
maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane
seat—or a beanbag chair!
Ross: Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how
to ride a bike!
Phoebe: Why? Why do I have to learn?
Ross: Well…In-in case of emergency.
Phoebe: What kind of an emergency?
Ross: Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head
and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."
Phoebe: Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the
gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Ross: Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold
you up and-and push you. Okay?
Phoebe: You won’t let go?
Ross: No!
Phoebe: Swear?!
Ross: I swear!
Phoebe: (thinks it over) Okay. 
Ross: Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They
start.) 
Phoebe: All right.
Ross: All right. Feel good?
Phoebe: Well…
Ross: All right, try pedaling. 
Phoebe: Okay. (Does so.)
Ross: That’s it, your doing great.
Phoebe: Okay.
Ross: Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Phoebe: Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
Ross: Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him
and falls off the bike.)
Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Ross: I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…
Phoebe: I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself
from the angry looks from onlookers.)
Ross: It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the
woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is making candy like mad as Ross
enters.]
Ross: Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.
Monica: Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve
only got two hands!!
Ross: Need some help?
Monica: No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with
the system!
Ross: By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She
glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)
[Cut to Phoebe’s room, Phoebe has put her helmet on one of her teddy bears and is
playing around with it. Ross knocks and pokes his head in the door.]
Phoebe: (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.
Ross: (entering) Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
Phoebe: I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
Ross: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so
close Phoebe!
Phoebe: Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have
no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something
that suspiciously looks like a bike.) 
Ross: Phoebe.
Phoebe: What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
Ross: All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride
this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.
Phoebe: What?! Why?!
Ross: Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this
guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be
played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it
you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
Phoebe: All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Ross: Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike very
happy.
Phoebe: (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)
Please don’t die!
[Scene: Rachel’s office, Tag and her are planning how to get the review back.]
Rachel: Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but
we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in
until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her
breakfast at her desk.
Tag: That’s kinda sad.
Rachel: Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her
away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,
you get in the office.
Tag: Got it!
Rachel: Let’s roll!
(They start towards the door but are stopped when Mr. Zelner enters.)
Mr. Zelner: Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Rachel: (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you
anything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to
usher Tag out.)
Mr. Zelner: Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you.
Rachel: Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some
chocolates? (Holds up the box.)
Mr. Zelner: Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty. (Rachel glances
at Tag to say, "See?") So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full
name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting
serious) what would happen exactly.
Mr. Zelner: Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult
with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Rachel: Well…
Tag: (interrupting) Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in that
evaluation.
Rachel: Oh no-no-no…
Tag: (interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Mr. Zelner: You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Tag: (pause) Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I’m kinda
strangely proud of my butt.
Mr. Zelner: It’s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing
I can’t figure out what this is?
Rachel: You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabs
the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter.
Mr. Zelner: Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh?
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place,
huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? (They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh,
you’ve (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)
Rachel: Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Tag: No, don’t worry about it.
Rachel: No, you could’ve lost your job.
Tag: Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work.
Rachel: Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.)
Tag: Y’know what? 
Rachel: What?
Tag: I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its
contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?
Rachel: I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Tag: Oh, I’m sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)
Rachel: (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler is returning from work to see the hallway jammed full of
people waiting outside their door.]
Chandler: (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on? 
The Man: We’re waiting for the candy. (Yelling at the door.) Bring out the
candy!
Joey: Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Chandler: Joey!
Joey: What’s up buddy?
Chandler: What are you doing?
Joey: Waiting for candy.
Chandler: Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot
Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!
(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
Monica: (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I
just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All: We want candy! We want candy now! (And other general commotion
sounds.)
Chandler: All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!
Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman
was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to
know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
The Man: (from earlier) Candy Lady?
Chandler: No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
Joey: (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have
candy?!!
Chandler: All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it!
You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!
Joey: That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You
ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to
the candy and starts eating it.)
Monica: (To Chandler) Thank you.
Chandler: You’re welcome. (They kiss.)
Monica: Did you smoke?
Chandler: No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
Eh-uh—are you okay?
Monica: I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean,
someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Joey: (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or
whatever, I don’t know… (Grabs the note.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Park, Phoebe is now riding her bike with ease and stops in front of
Ross. They both giggle.]
Phoebe: I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought
I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Ross: Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced
her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Phoebe: Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. (She
rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly
attached.)
EndPhoebe: Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
Chandler: Pheebs?
Phoebe: Huh?
Chandler: Skull?
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Rachel: (freaking out) Oh my god!!
Phoebe: No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she
used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people
still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of
licorice, and takes a bite.)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
All: Hey!
Monica: (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
Ross: (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for
the holidays this year.
All: Ohh! That's great!
Monica: Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Ross: Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this
year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Phoebe: And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people
die.
Rachel: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Ross: Hmm.
(Joey comes out of the bathroom reading a newspaper)
Joey: Hey. (He exits)
Rachel: (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
Monica: No.
Chandler: How long have we been home?
Monica: About a half an hour.
Chandler: Lovely!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is getting a cup of coffee and sits down next to
Monica.]
Chandler: Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna
change your last name to Bing?
Monica: No.
Chandler: Why not?
Monica: Bing's weird.
Phoebe: (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get
ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Monica: Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Phoebe: Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the
good news.
Chandler: Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Phoebe: Yeah, why not?
Chandler: Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be
living with him.
Phoebe: Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Chandler: No reason, except…she…told…me.
Phoebe: Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
Chandler: No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica
now.
Monica: Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Phoebe: You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Monica: Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Phoebe: Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look
surprised) Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh,
"Your mom probably won't kill herself," y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not
hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this
world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
Chandler: Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
[Scene: Joey and Rachel’s, Joey is sitting behind a red drum set.]
Rachel: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
(Starts drumming.)
Rachel: Drums?
Joey: (yelling) No! Drums!
[Scene: Michelle's, Chandler and Monica enter.]
Chandler: (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
(Laughs.)
Monica: I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Maitre d': Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Chandler: Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Maitre d': I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Chandler: Is this because of the burrito thing?
Monica: (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
Chandler: Give him money? It was a joke!
Monica: No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down.
Everybody wants to be paid off.
Chandler: Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Monica: You've got to be smooth about it.
Chandler: Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd
appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
Maitre d': Of course, sir.
Chandler: Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
Monica: How did it go?
Chandler: Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the
money in it)
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is whirling Ben around.]
Ross: Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do
ya?
Ben: No.
Ross: Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you
uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Ben: Christmas.
Ross: Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Ben: Christmas eve.
Ross: Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesn’t.) Hanukkah!
See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Ben: Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Ross: Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See,
years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Ben: (singing) Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Ross: (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh
(Sings) Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Ben: (singing) Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Ross: (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest.
Ben: When is Santa coming?
Ross: Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating
Hanukkah?
Ben: No Santa? Was I bad?
Ross: No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Ben: Santa's mad at me.
Ross: No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is
not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Ben: So Santa's coming?
Ross: (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
[Scene: Michelle's, Chandler and Monica are discussing how to bribe the Maitre
d'.]
Monica: It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and
give him the money!
Chandler: How do you know so much about this?
Monica: I don't know.
Chandler: Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Monica: We'd be eating our soup right now.
Chandler: Mustached bastard…
Monica: (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick!
Give him the money and get their table!
Chandler: (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
[Chandler can't find his money in the pocket. In the meantime, another couple shows up,
and Chandler turns away to look for his money]
Male Guest: (to the Maitre d') Good evening. (Shakes his hand)
Chandler: (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his
money, but he isn't there anymore)
[Scene: The Hallway, Phoebe comes up the stairs and hears drumming coming from Joey and
Rachel's, so she enters smiling and then sees that Rachel, not Joey, is the one playing.]
Rachel: (stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!
Phoebe: So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried,
that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well,
apparently not! So, yay!
Joey: Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel)
Ready? One, two, three, four...
[Rachel hits some tom-toms and ends up on the 'crash'-cymbal, which is in fact a
ride-cymbal, but whatever...]

Rachel and Joey: Tequila!!
Phoebe: That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is serving Chandler and Monica coffee.]
Gunther: Here you go.
Chandler: Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's
hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not
easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just
helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
Joey: Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey
Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.
Chandler: Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey! (she sits down next to him)
Chandler: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire
building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a
vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Monica: It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks
in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so
annoying.
Phoebe: Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react
to drums.
Monica: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live
there anymore?
Phoebe: Maybe on some level.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sitting behind the drums wearing safety goggles,
hitting them with his sticks as Rachel watches.]
Rachel: Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the
air.
Joey: What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Phoebe: (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you
another present. (She puts it on the counter)
Joey: Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what
is it?
Phoebe: It's a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool
jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,
gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Rachel: What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I
had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my
cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Joey: Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into
his room)
Rachel: Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Phoebe: (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey
is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)
Rachel: What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Phoebe: Our apartment is ready.
Rachel: And that makes you angry because…
Phoebe: Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Rachel: Where did you get that?
Phoebe: Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And
apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Rachel: Phoebe?
Phoebe: Hm?
Rachel: Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the
apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you
know how fish freaked me out!
Phoebe: (nods along) Fish!
Rachel: It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live
together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Phoebe: Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're
having so much fun over here…
Rachel: Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Phoebe: We did have fun, didn't we?
Rachel: We did!
Phoebe: Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Rachel: Oh, I would love to!
Phoebe: Yay, okay!
Rachel: Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the
sticks)
Phoebe: Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Rachel: (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and
puts the sticks into it) Done!
[Scene: Halloween Adventure, a costume shop, there is a salesman behind the
counter, Ross enters.]
Ross: Hey!
Salesman: Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Ross: No, these are my pants.
Salesman: Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Ross: Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Salesman: Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Ross: Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I
really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just opened the door for Ross who is
costumed as an Armadillo. Ben is standing next to her.]
Ross: I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to
wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!
Monica: What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Ross: (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Monica: Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way
from…Texas.
Ben: Texas?
Ross: That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.
And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend
down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the
Lady will help me with these presents.
[Monica picks up the bag, while Ross closes the door and hits Monica with his tail.
They walk into the living room, and Monica empties the bag.]
Ben: Wow! Thanks!
Ross: You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Ben: Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
Ross: (gasps) You are? Me, too!
Monica: Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Ross: (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if
the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Ben: Cool!
Ross: Yeah!
Monica: Come on Ben.
[Monica and Ben sit down on the couch.]
Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler: (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Ben: Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
Chandler: Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
Ross: What are you doing here, Santa?
Chandler: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,
weird…turtle-man?
Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to
give Ben some presents. Remember?
Chandler: What?
Ben: Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
Chandler: You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money
falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands
weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!
Monica: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the
Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought
I'd say.
[They walk to the kitchen; everyone is lowering their voices]
Ross: (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Chandler: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa
costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Ross: Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Chandler: Why?
Ross: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and
you're-you’re wrecking it.
Chandler: But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross: I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Chandler: Fine, I'll give the suit back.
[Ross turns around and walks back to Ben.]
Monica: (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a
really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
Chandler: Santa? Really?
Monica: Yes, is that okay?
Chandler: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica: No.
Chandler: Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
Ross: Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Ben: No! Why does he have to go?
Chandler: Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are
ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Ben: No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Ross: Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Chandler: Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,
will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Ben: Okay, Santa!
(Ross mouths to Chandler, "Thank you," and he mouths, "You’re
welcome," back.)
Ross: All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there
were these people called the Maccabees.
[Joey enters in a Superman-costume]

[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, they are entering to check out the newly refurbished
apartment.]

Phoebe: Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t
even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!
Rachel: (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
Phoebe: What?
Rachel: (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your
grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Rachel: And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find
out and then tear it down?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Rachel: Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods,
"No.") It left! It’s one huge room!
Phoebe: Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!
Rachel: See?
Phoebe: Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
Rachel: You can’t, because of the new skylight!
Phoebe: There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)
Wow!!
Rachel: So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Phoebe: (returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my
grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Rachel: Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
Phoebe: A little bit, yeah.
Rachel: Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Phoebe: You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Rachel: Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.
Phoebe: Are you sure?
Rachel: Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun.
Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.
Phoebe: Oh me too.
Rachel: I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,
I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep
the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Phoebe: No, I do not hear that.
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Santa (Chandler), Superman (Joey), Ben,
and Monica are listening to the Holiday Armadillo (Ross) finish telling the story of
Hanukkah.]
Ross: …and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve
just lasted just one day, burned for…
Ben: (answering him) Eight whole days.
Ross: That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The
end.
Ben: Awesome!
Ross: Yeah?
Chandler: My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of
Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.)
Ross: The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay
Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben,
and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
Rachel: (entering with Phoebe) Hey! 
Phoebe: Oh.
Rachel: (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter
Bunny’s funeral in here.
Ross: Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
Rachel: Oh.
Phoebe: Oh.
(They both go over to light the candles.)
Phoebe: Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a
porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?

(Joey throws open his door and stands there still in the Superman costume then
slowly makes his way to the bathroom while keeping both eyes on the cage.)

Aunt Millie: Isn’t it a beautiful wedding?!
Ross: Yes, yes it is. It’s uh… (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to
grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a
napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
(Cousin Frannie and her husband enter.)
Monica: Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me? (Starts to
get up and great Frannie.)
Ross: Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so
you can ambush her.
Monica: Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to
mom.
Ross: That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on
Frannie’s shoulder.)
Frannie: (turning around) Monica! What…
Monica: Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you
like that?!
Ross: (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Monica: You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?!
What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!
(Frannie’s husband walks up.) Stuart!
Frannie: I believe you know my husband.
(Monica is shocked into silence.)
Ross: So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.

David: July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.) 
Phoebe: That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?
David: Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.
Phoebe: That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
David: Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I
figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.
Phoebe: You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it. 
David: I-I do though.
Phoebe: I do too. (They kiss.)
David: Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and
witnesses that event.)
Phoebe: (seeing him) Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell
at me tomorrow.
Joey: No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know,
started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first
time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?
Phoebe: No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has
gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again. (Crying.)
Joey: Hey, y’know you could always visit him.
Phoebe: Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.
Joey: Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Phoebe: Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of
sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)
Joey: I can give it a shot.

them?
Tag: What contracts?
Rachel: Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that
I don’t get.

starts laughing.) Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely
had to go out today!
Tag: Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!
Rachel: Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must
go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in
the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.
Tag: I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.
Rachel: Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those
contracts sitting on your desk.
Tag: No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my
desk!
Rachel: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on
the phone with your crotch!
Tag: You wanna go down to the office right now?
Rachel: No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.
Tag: Okay I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong
either.

Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?
Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish
red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there…you go up to the
roof and you let me in.
Joey: Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Ross: Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy
jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
Joey: What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Ross: Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.
Joey: (looks at the ground and at Ross) I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you
what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Ross: Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the
landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
Joey: No.
Ross: Okay. Well, you be careful.
Joey: What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an
audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.
Ross: Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father
if-if I die!
Joey: Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!

do… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up
and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has
stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance

You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A
little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Tag: It’s my sister.
Rachel: Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is
Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes
into her office.)
Tag: So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the
afternoon?
Rachel: In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put
them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds
the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave
Tag) that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All
right?
Commercial Break
[Scene: Rachel’s outer office, Tag has finished searching his desk and Rachel
comes out to try to plant the folder on the desk.]
Tag: It’s not here.
Rachel: Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room,
maybe you left the contracts in there?
Tag: How could I have left them in the copy room?
Rachel: I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?
It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
Tag: Fine.
Rachel: Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom
drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the
phone.) I still don’t get it.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Chandler has his eyes closed, while Monica is
fully awake.]
Monica: Are you still awake?
Chandler: Yeah! You?
Monica: You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn’t
respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we’re both up…
Chandler: (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinking
about cleaning the living room.
[Scene: The fire escape, Joey and Ross are still trying to figure out how to get down.]
Joey: Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do
you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Ross: (looking in the window behind them) Y’know, y’know I’m
lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the
window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
Joey: Yeah? Really? No one’s home?
Ross: I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,
large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the
landing.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)
[Scene: Phoebe’s apartment building, in desperation she has wrapped up the smoke
detector in a blanket and is going to throw it into the trash chute.]
Phoebe: Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the
chute.) Noisy bitch!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Chandler is turning on the light to awaken a now
sleeping Monica.]
Monica: What?! What are you doing?!
Chandler: Do you know what just happened?
Monica: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Chandler: No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
Monica: Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me
world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)
Chandler: (turning the light back on) Monica?
Monica: What?!
Chandler: I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please
wake up so we can do it right!
Monica: Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Give me the good stuff.
Chandler: Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay,
I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and as
he’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over
the kitchen floor.
Monica: Okay, I’m up! I’m up!
[Scene: Rachel’s outer office, she’s returning with two coffee cups in hand
to find Tag sitting there.]
Rachel: Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh… (She looks for a place to set it
on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Do
you got anything for me?
Tag: Still no luck.
Rachel: Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the
drawers!
Tag: Do you want me to check again?
Rachel: Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no
it’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one
and he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
Tag: Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your
office?
Rachel: (thinks) Y’know, I don’t-I don’t know. Let me, let me
check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks into
her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
Tag: (smirking) Any luck?
Rachel: Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Tag: (entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is not
amused, because she’s still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every
‘good’ boss.) Y’know what? I’m not even going to gloat. I’m just
really relived this whole thing is over.
Rachel: You put these on my desk!
Tag: I did not!
Rachel: Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your
bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert
should have a line here.)
Tag: How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Rachel: (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I
am so hot for you right now.
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment, there is someone pounding on the door and Phoebe sleepily
walks over and answers it. As she nears the door, the pounding stops and she can hear the
smoke detector’s wail.]
Phoebe: Oh my God! How did you get back here?!

A Disembodied Voice: (yelling through the door) Phoebe Buffay?!
Phoebe: (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the
blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?
The Fireman: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Phoebe: That’s not mine.
The Fireman: Yes it is.
Phoebe: How do you know?
The Fireman: The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute,
don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not
Monica."
Phoebe: Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last
time I checked this was still America!
The Fireman: Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them.
Phoebe: Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them
from going off!
The Fireman: There’s a reset button under the plastic cover.
Phoebe: There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and
she goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that!
(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,
where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)
Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to
the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,
God!
[Scene: The fire escape, Joey is now hanging off of the bottom rung of the ladder that
won’t move and Ross is watching from above.]
Ross: Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Joey: Yeah!
Ross: Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now.
Joey: All right! Just hurry up!
Ross: Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to
face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
Joey: I think face to face.
Ross: I would say that.
Joey: Face to face, yeah!
Ross: Okay, here I go.
Joey: All right. 
(Ross steps onto the bottom rung of the ladder and then steps on Joey’s chest.)
Joey: (grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
Ross: I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little
holiday weight.
(Ross continues to climb down. He puts his other foot further down on Joey’s
torso, but that doesn’t work very well and he’s forced to wrap his legs around
Joey. Which then forces Joey to get a nice and close view of Ross’s crotch.)
Joey: Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we
thought it all the way through.
Ross: So what do you want me to do?
Joey: Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
(Ross continues his trek south, and when they get face to face.)
Ross: Hi.
Joey: Hi.
Ross: (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Joey: (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Ross: It’s still looks pretty far!
Joey: It’s not that far! Just drop!
Ross: Do not rush me!!
(Ross continues south and his now wrapped around Joey’s legs.)
Joey: Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and
I’m not wearing any underwear!
(Ross panics and falls off, dropping to the ground with a huge crash.)
Ross: Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when
I—Ooh, a quarter!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's bedroom, they’re cuddling.]
Monica: That really was some of your best work.
Chandler: Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe that
I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Monica: I have to be up in seven minutes.
Chandler: Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven
minutes…
Monica: Really?!
Chandler: Do you wanna?
Monica: Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!
(She runs off leaving a stunned Chandler behind.)
EndMonica: She’s my favorite character on DOOL.
Joey: Nice.
Rachel: She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I
don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.
Monica: And the way she slaps all the time!
Rachel: Oh!
Monica: Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards
Chandler.)
Chandler: Don’t do it.
Rachel: Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Joey: Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s
gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Ross: Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain
transplant," you are going to be her?
Joey: Yes, but in Drake Remoray’s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is
this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch in Central Perk]
Phoebe: (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Rachel: (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.
Phoebe: Yeah? Why?
Rachel: Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Phoebe: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an
attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
Rachel: Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Phoebe: (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us
figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
Rachel: All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
Phoebe: Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Rachel: Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Phoebe: Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Rachel: What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and
I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Phoebe: Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both
get up.)
Rachel: What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
Phoebe: I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Rachel: Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Phoebe: That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting
together…(quietly) having sex.
Rachel: Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Phoebe: No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Rachel: Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn’t think I’d love
again.
Phoebe: Nice try.
Rachel: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Phoebe: I don’t know. 
(They edge closer to the phone on the table.)
Rachel: Well umm, maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!! 
(She holds the phone out and starts taunting Phoebe. Phoebe calming knocks the phone
out of Rachel’s hand and catches it.)
Phoebe: Ah-ha! Too cocky!
[Scene: Silvercup Studios, Joey is watching Jessica Lockhart perform a scene.]
Dina: I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can
do about it!
Jessica Lockhart: Oh yes there is!
Dina: What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Jessica Lockhart: (gasps) That was an accident! And so were you.
Dina: Well, at least I’m not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)
Jessica Lockhart: (crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dina’s head
to her other shoulder so that she’s the only one in the picture.)
The Director: Cut!
(Joey walks up to Cecilia Monroe who plays Jessica.)
Joey: That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do
that?
Cecilia: Oh, just years of experience.
Dina: (crying) Can I get some ice here?!
Joey: Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Cecilia: You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?
Joey: Say what?
Cecilia: I’m supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that’s
not supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!
Joey: No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.
I-I’m the guy in the coma!
Cecilia: Oh that was a real person?!
Joey: An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain
when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…
Cecilia: I-I-I’m leaving the show?
Joey: (quickly) I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?
Cecilia: Who told you that?
Joey: Oh uh, one of the writers.
Cecilia: Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Joey: Umm…
Cecilia: Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!
Joey: Okay.
Cecilia: And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips
about a character that I’ve been playing for 20 years—I’ll give you a tip!
(She throws her drink in his face.)
Joey: Ms. Monroe… (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving
Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just
received.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still arguing over the phone.]
Rachel: No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay
look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has
on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And
then whoever does gets the phone.
Phoebe: Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Rachel: I don’t think so.
Phoebe: (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d
be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Rachel: (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is
mom.
Phoebe: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Rachel: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last
blueberry muffin.
Phoebe: Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
Rachel: Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’t
telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T
hat’s a steak house!
Phoebe: Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.
Rachel: (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s
on his speed dial.
Phoebe: So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That
can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the
store on their speed dial?
Rachel: (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are eating lunch, when they start to
hear a horrible screeching noise. It sounds like someone is skinning a cat.]
Monica: What is that?
Chandler: I think it’s the dying cat parade.
Monica: It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.
Chandler: (turning around and looking) Oh my God!
Monica: What?
Chandler: Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was
hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re half
Scottish right?"
Monica: Nooo!!
Chandler: Yes!!
[Cut to Ross’s apartment, he his playing the Bagpipes, badly. He’s worse than
that whole keyboard thing a few years ago.]
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier. They both get up and move
to the window.]
Monica: No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the
window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why
is your family Scottish?!
Chandler: Why is your family Ross?!
Monica: He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come
on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!
Chandler: If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool
and the Gang.
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is putting out some Sunflower seeds as Rachel
enters.]
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: How are ya?
Phoebe: Good.
Rachel: Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I
was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it
rang I could just pick it up?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Phoebe: Ooh, now you lost me.
Rachel: You stole the phone!
Phoebe: No I didn’t!
Rachel: No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?
Phoebe: No.
Rachel: Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new
ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh, it
does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)
Rachel: Phoebe!
Phoebe: That is a different phone.
Rachel: Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her
phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.
(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It’s for me!
Phoebe: That is damning evidence.
(The cute guy’s phone rings.)
Rachel: Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to
begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be
(Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand,
catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!
Phoebe: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I’m the one who found your phone.
Rachel: Phoebe! You can’t do th…
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can
pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 Morton
Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or
whatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)
Rachel: You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Phoebe: Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Rachel: You just said it!
Phoebe: Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone
y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Rachel: Oh Phoebe!
Phoebe: What?! That’s the first time today!
Rachel: Ohh! (Exits.)
[Scene: Silvercup Studios, Dina is at the craft services table getting some food as
Joey walks up.]
Joey: So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…
Dina: (interrupting) I’m 16.
Joey: See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
Cecilia: (walking up) You’re absolutely right they are writing me out of
the show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently
going to be very soon and that’s it.
Joey: I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the
show.
Cecilia: Yeah, thanks.
Joey: No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your
fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Cecilia: Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again?
Joey: Joey.
Cecilia: Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws her
drink on a passing writer.)
The Writer: It wasn’t my decision!
Cecilia: (to him) I’m having a conversation here! (To Joey) You were
saying?
Joey: Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,
that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being
you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know?
Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Cecilia: All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid
show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Joey: Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!
Cecilia: You’re so welcome.
Joey: Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? (In a
British accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
Ever!!"
Cecilia: Is that supposed to be me?
Joey: Yeah.
Cecilia: Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent.
Joey: (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my
resume!
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch. Ross is sitting on
the armchair.]
Chandler: Well, I feel like a snack!
Monica: Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
Chandler: Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish
heritage.
Ross: What?!
Chandler: Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland
by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
Ross: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its
Scottish roots.
Monica: No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But
y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous
for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Ross: Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
Monica: (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Ross: How did you know about that?!
Chandler: We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Ross: Were you the ones called the cops?!
Chandler: That’s not really important right now. What is important is;
while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our
wedding.
Ross: Why not?
Chandler: Because we hate them.
Ross: Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
Chandler: We have heard you play.
Ross: No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to
perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what
song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll
bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.
[Scene: Silvercup Studios, Joey is getting pointers on how to play Jessica Lockhart.]
Cecilia: So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when
Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.
(Joey is nodding.) You try.
Joey: Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)
All right!
Cecilia: No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not
finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Joey: Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
Cecilia: Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns
it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!
(Joey gets a snooty look on his face.) All right, it’s a little weird, but it’s
getting better. (Joey is pleased.) Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much. I
don’t know what I’m going to do! I mean, it’s been 20 years of my life.
Joey: Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.
Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different
characters. You’re so talented.
Cecilia: I am. I am, but I don’t know you know. An actor of a certain age
is not that easy.
Joey: Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina
Jolie!
Cecilia: I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were
pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And… Ohh, I turned down some
amazing work!
Joey: Like-like what?
Cecilia: Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of
Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Joey: (impressed) Wow!
Cecilia: But… Well now, now’s a different time for me. (Starts to
cry.)
Joey: Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look
let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking,
"Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (She’s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am
also thinking, "She is hot!"
Cecilia: (intrigued) You think I’m hot?
Joey: You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We
should probably get-get uh…
Cecilia: Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the… (Pause) So when Jessica kisses a
man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man’s face. (She does so.)
Joey: Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?
Cecilia: No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes her
hands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?
Joey: Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
Cecilia: That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a
little off, they should be maybe right like… (She grabs the back of his neck and
kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are waiting for the cute guy to show up
for his cell phone. Rachel is putting on perfume by spraying it ahead of her face, and
moving into it. Phoebe tries to steal some.]
Rachel: Hey! Hey!
(There is a knock on the door.)

Phoebe and Rachel: (simultaneously) Who is it?

Guy: Hi! It’s Tom, I’m here to pick up the phone.
(Rachel excitedly jumps up and heads for the door.)
Phoebe: Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Rachel: Well why shouldn’t I?!
Phoebe: Because it’s my apartment!
Rachel: Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Phoebe: Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the
calls to China.
(Phoebe opens the door and Tom, an older gentleman with white hair, enters.)
Tom: Hi!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Rachel: (laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone.
Tom: No that’s my assistant.
Rachel: Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
Tom: Umm, no.
Phoebe: Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Tom: Sure!
Rachel: We’ll be right back sir.
Tom: Sure.
(They walk into the living room.)
Phoebe: Wh-what do we do?
Rachel: I don’t know!
Phoebe: Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for
a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Rachel: I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
Phoebe: Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!
Rachel: (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to
wait.
Phoebe: Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really
owe you one.
Rachel: (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have
him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Phoebe: Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
Rachel: Ohh…
Tom: So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Phoebe: Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
Tom: Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
Phoebe: (whispering) Nice!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Cecilia is entering the living room from Joey’s room
followed by Joey.]
Cecilia: Well, you certainly own that room.
Joey: Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
(She laughs as Rachel enters.)
Rachel: Hi.
Joey: Hey!
(Rachel stops dead in her tracks when she sees whom Joey is with.)
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am
such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Cecilia: Well, it’s nice to know that you…
Rachel: (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica’s.)
Joey: That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Cecilia: Oh that explains all the women’s underwear.
Joey: (shrugs) Sure. Yep.
Monica: (entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so
amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Cecilia: Certainly.
Monica: Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to
her cheek.)
Cecilia: I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.
Rachel: God. You seem really, really nice.
Joey: Okay, bye-bye.
Rachel: I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Joey: All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the
apartment.)
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To
Cecilia) Umm, you’re a stupid bitch.
Cecilia: I really can’t slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)
Rachel: You are so beautiful.
Monica: Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!
Joey: Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To
Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I…
Cecilia: Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worry
about it.
Joey: (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
Cecilia: What?
Joey: They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!
Cecilia: They don’t?
Joey: Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes
what that means.) Oh…
Cecilia: How does it happen?
Joey: (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an
electric fence.
Cecilia: Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Joey: Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy
about electricity either.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica have gathered to
hear Ross perform his interpretation of Celebration by Cool and the Gang on
the bag pipe.]
Ross: …now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Rachel: (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee
socks.
Ross: (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Rachel: No!
Ross: (stands up) Now umm, remember I’m still learning.
(As he prepares to start, he makes several horrible noises that scares Rachel into
retreat.)
Ross: One, two, three, four!
(He starts. And well, Celebration was never meant to be played on the bagpipe,
so even the best bag pipe players in the world would have trouble with that particular
song. So of course, for a beginner like Ross, it sounds absolutely dreadful. The assembled
audience minus Phoebe, are horrified. Phoebe, immune to bad music, seems to enjoy it.)
Ross: You know the song! Sing along!
(Ross resumes playing, this time accompanied by Phoebe screeching out E’s in tune
with Ross. While Phoebe is singing along, Rachel is having a very difficult time keeping a
straight face. Thankfully, Ross gives up after a little while.)
Ross: So?

Monica and Chandler: No!
(Ross throws the bagpipes down in disgust.)
[Scene: Silvercup Studios, a scene is being shot where Dina and Fredrick are
celebrating Jessica’s horrible accident by drinking champagne.]
Dina: Loosening the saddle on mother’s horse was brilliant Fredrick. And
the electric fence, inspired.
Fredrick: Thank you sweetheart. (They clink glasses.)
Dina: I can’t believe she’s really gone. Look around you, all of this
is ours. (They move into kiss but; they’re stopped by Joey entering with a huge
bandage wrapped around his head.)
Joey: (as Jessica) I don’t think so.
Dina: Who are you?!
Jessica Lockhart: What’s the matter Dina? Don’t you recognize your own
(Does a hair flip) mother?!

The Director: Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
Cecilia: (running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I think
that you’re a better Jessica than I ever was!
Joey: Oh noo…
Cecilia: Well of course not, but you were very good.
Joey: Thanks!
Cecilia: And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Joey: Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Cecilia: A film in Guadalajara!
Joey: The airport?
Cecilia: No that’s La Guardia. (Joey nods in recognition.) This is Mexico.
Joey: Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Cecilia: Eight months.
Joey: That’s a really long time.
Cecilia: Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few
places down there.
Joey: Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.
(Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya, that is a
tricky one!
Cecilia: That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You’ve,
well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Joey: Good luck.
Cecilia: You too.
(They kiss and both put their hands on the other’s face like Jessica would do.)
Ending Credits
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica have gathered to
hear Ross perform his interpretation of Celebration by Cool and the Gang on
the bag pipe. Yes, I typed that earlier. We’re seeing this again, only this time Ross
as already started playing.]
Ross: You know the song! Sing along!
Phoebe: Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!! 
(Monica (Courtney Cox) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) are laughing. That then causes Lisa
and Jennifer come out of character and start laughing hysterically. And that
finally causes David Schwimmer to come out of character and start laughing as well.
Matthew decides to sing along now as well.)
Matthew Perry: Eee!! (This causes more laughter.)
Lisa Kudrow: Do it again!
(Matthew mimics the sound again.)
End
(Why was this the trailer? Well, that’s because it was an introduction into the
special out takes episode that immediately followed the show. The entire out takes
episode, Friends: The Stuff You’ve Never Seen can be read
by following this link.)Chandler: Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively
ruined.
Monica: Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!
Chandler: Eh!
(They start making out again, and it takes Joey trying to enter to stop them.)
Chandler: Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers
as Joey enters. Remember?)
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is
turned off.)
Joey: Oh, dude I’m so sorry!
Chandler: No! No! No!
Joey: Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a
second, I’m still with my bride’s maid, I just—Where are those condoms you
brought?
Chandler: They’re in my bag over there. (Points.)
Joey: Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler’s bag by getting as far away from
Chandler’s bed as possible.)
Chandler: Uh, could you leave me one?
Joey: (pause) For just you?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some
really nice girls down there.
Chandler: No I-I-I’m fine.
Joey: All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)
[Cut back to Monica and Chandler telling Phoebe and Joey the story.]
Joey: That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you
were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Monica: Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing
nothing for me.
Joey: Oh… (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last
one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent
that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!
Phoebe: Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you
originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Monica: What?!
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: (To Joey) What?!
Chandler: Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Monica: Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really
depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just
wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually
looking…for Joey. (Joey smiles.)
Joey: Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier.]
Chandler: (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever
in-intend on telling me about this?
Monica: No because it-it didn’t seem important.
Chandler: Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it
wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
Monica: Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It
is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Joey: And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(Shuts
up on Monica’s glare.)
Chandler: I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and
I’m runner up.
Monica: Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was
not there that night?!
Joey: Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I’m a man of the cloth, but
I still have feelings!
Chandler: (To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now.
Okay?
Joey: What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my
bride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I
mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of
this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Chandler: Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing
their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I
don’t know what I need. I need a walk.
Monica: Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!
Chandler: It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you
had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
Joey: This is crazy.
Phoebe: I know! Robin is so gay!
[Scene: Carol and Susan’s, Rachel is talking with Ben.]
Rachel: So now what have we agreed?
Ben: No more pranks.
Rachel: And-and what else?
Ben: That you and daddy were not on a break.
Rachel: Very good.
(There’s a knock on the door and Ross enters.)
Ross: Rachel! What are you doing here?
Rachel: I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.
Ross: Your good friend?
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: What’s her last name?
Rachel: Carol…Lesbian?
Ross: Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Rachel: What line?
Ross: Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class
of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) "Dude, don’t you ever was
your face?"
Rachel: All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you
were so mad already!
Ross: Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s
not funny!
Carol: (entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!
Ross: Hi.
Carol: What’s not funny?
Ross: Practical jokes.
Carol: Oh I…I think they’re funny.
Ross: You have a line down your face.
Carol: What? (Goes and checks.)
Rachel: Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…
Carol: (yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!
Rachel: Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Ross: Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid
who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office
wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
Rachel: That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really
just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Ross: I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff
anymore. Okay?
Rachel: Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that
stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go
back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!
Ross: No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding
but I…
Rachel: Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna
have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal
6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!
Ben: (yelling from off camera) Crap!!
Rachel: I gotta go! (Runs out.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sulking on the couch as Joey enters to talk with
him.]
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but
it would probably rather sleep with you!
Joey: Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Chandler: Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…
Joey: No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t
care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.
Chandler: How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this
fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Joey: Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the
rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there!
Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys
are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it
just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.
Chandler: That’s what you should say.
Joey: What?
Chandler: When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
Joey: Really? I can do it?
Chandler: I’d love it if you would do it.
Joey: Hey! (They hug.)
Chandler: But those are the words! Those exact words!
Joey: Well I don’t know remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty
much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is in the kitchen as Ross and Ben are entering.]
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you
can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he
asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…
Rachel: Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben?
(He nods yes.)
Ross: Okay, I’ll see you later pal.
(Ross turns to leave.)
Rachel: Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘Poop.’)
Wh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.
Ross: What?
Rachel: I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. (To Ross)
You’ve got something here on your back.
Ross: What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great.
That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just
finish talking about Ben?!
Rachel: Oh I…
Ben: What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Ross: All right, that’s it! (He runs over to Ben, but he runs past him and
out the door.) Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!
Rachel: No! Wait! Come on!
[Cut to the hallway, Ben runs upstairs with Ross in pursuit.]
Ross: Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Rachel: No you guys… (She walks out into the hallway.)
Ross: I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the
stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)
Rachel: EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to
him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are entering. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on
the couch.]
Joey: Hey!
Monica: Hey-hey.
Joey: So are guys doing okay?
Chandler: Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little
bit and some things in life are more important.
Monica: Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)
Phoebe: I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what
would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.
[Scene: Monica and Joey’s, Monica is cooking.]
Monica: Honey! Dinner’s ready!
(Joey, whose new diet is working out great, he looks like he only weighs 375 down from
420 enters from the bedroom.)
Fat Joey: What’s my little chef got for me tonight?
Monica: Your favorite!
Joey: Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!
Monica: Yep! And lot’s of it!
Fat Joey: Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. (They
kiss.) Okay.
(Joey sits down.)
Monica: Okay, in we go.
(Monica gets behind him and in combination with his sliding the chair forward and her
pushing with her leg manages to get up to the table.)
Fat Joey: Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! (Groans and picks
up a piece of food.) How you doin’?
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is getting Phoebe some coffee.]
Joey: Here you go.
Phoebe: (still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks
her watch) That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Joey: Good for you!
Phoebe: Oh, it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, (reads
the side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no
shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—Oh.
EndRoss: Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.

The Woman: It-it’s really heavy.
Ross: (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.)
(Calmly) So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly
waves.)

The Woman: I-I am Kristen.
Ross: Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you
are…I’d love to show you around sometime.
Kristen: I…I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ross: Ah.
Kristen: But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Ross: Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this
street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen
crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the
street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking
about.)
Chandler: (To Ross) Smooth.
Kristen: (To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)
Ross: Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you
say I take you to dinner tonight?
Kristen: Oh I’d like that.
Ross: Yeah?
Kristen: Yeah.
Ross: Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he’s holding.)
Kristen: After you.
Ross: Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When
she’s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can’t pick it up.)
[Scene: A Bridal Shop, Phoebe and Rachel are waiting for Monica who is trying on her
wedding dress.]
Phoebe: (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
(Monica enters from the dressing room wearing her gown.)
Rachel: Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Monica: This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!
(Another woman walks up.)

The Woman: Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I’d cry.
Monica: Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby.

The Woman: I’m Megan Bailey.
Monica: Have you found your dress yet?
Megan: Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could
afford one.
Monica: No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just to
figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount
place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Megan: Oh, thanks for the tip.
Monica: Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Megan: Oh I’m not, I just like to try these on.
Rachel: I do the same thing.
Megan: I’m just kidding. I’m getting married July 25th.
Rachel: I’m just kidding too. (Laughs) I’m getting married in
December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)
Megan: (To Monica) So when are you getting married?
Monica: Oh May 15th.
Megan: Oooh it’s getting close!
Monica: Yeah!
Megan: So uh, who’s your photographer?
Monica: Jeffery.
Megan: We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
Monica: The best man? Wow!
Megan: I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who’s your band?!
Monica: Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Megan: Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. 
Phoebe: Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God!
It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!
(Another woman walks past Rachel carrying a wedding dress.)
Rachel: Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want
you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.

The Woman: I own this store.
Rachel: So, does this (The dress) come in another color or… (The store
owner walks away.)
[Scene: A Street, Joey is walking by Kristen who is still moving in.]
Joey: (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out?
Kristen: I’m moving in.
Joey: Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Kristen: Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me
before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Joey: Boyfriend?
Kristen: No.
Joey: I’m Joey. (They shake hands.)
Kristen: Kristen.
Joey: Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?
Kristen: Kristen.
Joey: Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So…
Kristen: So uh, do you live around here?
Joey: Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a
little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your
shoes gone.
Kristen: I’ll remember that.
Joey: Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me
tonight?
Kristen: Oh I, I have plans tonight. 
Joey: Oh.
Kristen: But how about tomorrow?
Joey: Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go? (The lamp he’s
holding.)
Kristen: You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the
boxes.
Joey: Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but
decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I’ll grab this one. (He
follows her upstairs.)
[Scene: Kleinman’s, a horde of women including Rachel, Phoebe, and Monica are
waiting for the store to open.]

A Woman: What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
Rachel: (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
Monica: All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so
when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! (Holds up
a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She
passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: Got it.
Monica: All right.
(A worker comes to open the door and the horde starts to press forward.)

A Woman: Here he comes! Hurry!
Rachel: Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!
Monica: (To Rachel) Hey! Don’t be a baby!
Rachel: Well I…
(The door opens allowing the horde to charge in, knocking Rachel out of the way and to
the ground.)

A Woman: Let’s go!!
Phoebe: (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
[Time lapse, inside the store, Monica is frantically looking for her dress.]
Monica: No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman
tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don’t crowd me! (Finds it) This is it!
This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone
has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I’m sorry, this
one’s taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!
Monica: Megan!
Megan: Monica!
Monica: You came?!
Megan: Yeah!
Monica: This is my dress!
Megan: No!
Monica: Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Megan: And now you’ll see me buying it.
Monica: What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if
it wasn’t for me!
Megan: Look, you don’t want to fight me.
Monica: Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)
[Cut to Phoebe in another part of the store.]
Phoebe: (hearing the signal) I’m coming! I’m coming! (She takes off
towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)

Woman: Hey!
(She hears another signal in another direction.)
Phoebe: Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the
other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and
finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the
way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What
are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop
so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
Phoebe: Did you find the dress?
Rachel: No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are
crazy!
Phoebe: I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
Rachel: No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Phoebe: Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.)
Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.) 
(She gets to Monica who has the dress balled up in one hand and is sitting on Megan who
is sprawled out on the floor.)
Monica: (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!
Rachel: (seeing who’s trapped) Hey…
Monica: NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are there.]
Chandler: So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the
magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Ross: Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying
she’d like to go out again.
Chandler: Huh.
Ross: Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make
sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
Joey: (entering) Hey Chandler!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.
Chandler: Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you
don’t come by? That’s okay!
Joey: Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right
across the street!
Chandler: Really? Right across the street?
Joey: Yeah!
Chandler: When’d you meet her?
Joey: Two days ago.
Chandler: Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
Joey: Oh yeah?
Ross: (returning) Hey.
Chandler: Hi! How’d it go?
Ross: Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s
also seeing some other guy.
Chandler: (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in
Ross’s situation?
Joey: Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also
seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not to worried about it.
Ross: Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy
who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Chandler: So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But
unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way,
what’s the name the girl you’re dating?

Joey and Ross: Kristen Lang.
Chandler: Bye! (Exits.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, time lapse from the earlier scene.]
Ross: Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Joey: Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Ross: Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should
date her…
Joey: (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates
her.
Ross: That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…
Joey: Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…
Ross: Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Joey: Yeah well we should order some food then.
Ross: No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay?
Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who
she likes best.
Joey: (smiling) That sounds fair.
Ross: Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the
street…
Joey: Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a
spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like
that.
Ross: Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.
Joey: All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.
Ross: So let’s decide on the spending limit…
Joey: Yeah. Uh, (thinks)…a slice…(Thinks)…six dollars?
Ross: I was thinking more like a hundred.
Joey: Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are admiring Monica’s
wedding dress.]
Monica: Oh…
Phoebe: I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
(Rachel goes to the fridge, opens it, and blows on the whistle Monica gave her at the
store, which causes Phoebe and Monica to turn around and look at her.)
Rachel: You’re out of Diet Coke.
(The phone rings and Monica answers it as Rachel goes into the bathroom.)
Monica: Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen
here missy! (Listens) Wh—(She is hung up on.)
Phoebe: What?!
Monica: That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our
wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Phoebe: (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
Monica: What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress!
Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Phoebe: Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Monica: How?
(There are three short whistle blasts from the bathroom.)
Rachel: You’re out of toilet paper!
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is getting ready for his date with Kristen.]
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey! What’s up?
Joey: I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.
Ross: Oh thanks!
Joey: Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Ross: We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Joey: Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.
Ross: I am dressed.
Joey: Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is
this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Ross: I have an oily T-zone!
Joey: Okay dude! (Finds a receit.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Ross: That’s right.
Joey: You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!
Ross: Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically
I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Joey: Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the
rules too y’know!
Ross: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Joey: I don’t know.
Ross: Why am I not surprised?
Joey: Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!
Ross: I don’t think you have much choice.
Joey: Well we’ll see!
Ross: Bye-bye!
Joey: Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So
just a light layer?
Ross: Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and
there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is entering without touching anything with his
hands. Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel are there.]
Chandler: Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom
to wash his hands.)
Phoebe: Yeah, swing music is so out.
Monica: Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.
Chandler: (returning) What are you guys talking about?
Monica: Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings
and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.
Rachel: Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two
months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any
connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.
Chandler: But I love swing music!
Phoebe: Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people
actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
Chandler: Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And
there’s another reason too.
Rachel: Well, what is the other reason?
Chandler: I don’t want to say.
Rachel: Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
Chandler: Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it
was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my
dances with.
Monica: Oh crap!
[Scene: Grammercy Bistero, Ross and Kristen are waiting for their table to be ready.
Ross is returning from talking to the matire’d.]
Ross: So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Kristen: Oh great!
Ross: Yeah.
Kristen: Is your back feeling better?
Ross: Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they
can spasim out of control.
Joey: (entering) Kristen?
Kristen: Joey!
Joey: Hi!
Kristen: Hi! What are you doing here?
Joey: Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking
any rules so I…
Kristen: Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Joey: Hi!
Ross: Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a
friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.
Kristen: Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Ross: Yeah. So…
Joey: Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)
Ross: So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Kristen: Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the
stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Ross: That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?
Joey: A woman in a man’s body.
Ross: Much better.
Joey: So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me
too. Have you ever been married?
Ross: Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were
talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.
Kristen: Yeah, little Eric.
Ross: That’s right! Wait no, Ben.
Joey: So you’ve just married the one time then?
Ross: Well umm…
Kristen: You’ve been married twice?
Ross: Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey,
have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some
of her food?
Kristen: You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Joey: (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first
marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Kristen: Do you two know each other?

Joey and Ross: No. No.
Joey: No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman
on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
(Kristen is not enjoying this.)
Ross: Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Joey: Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Ross: Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Joey: Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Ross: Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Joey: Monkey lover!
(They both notice that Kristen has left.)
Joey: When do you think we lost her?
Ross: Probably around gonorrhea.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is entering.]
Chandler: Hi, honey! I’m home!
Monica: (from the bedroom) Don’t come in here!
Chandler: Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Monica: No! We only mess around at his place!
Chandler: Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scary me.
So could you come out here please?
Monica: No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.
Chandler: Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!
Monica: Yeah but I’m not keeping it.
Chandler: Well then why can’t I see it?
Monica: Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t
like it.
Chandler: Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow!
You-you look…hideous.
Monica: Really?
Chandler: Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen.
Wh-why do you to return it?
Monica: Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked
the Swing Kings.
Chandler: Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s
like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Monica: Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Chandler: Okay!
Ending Credits
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are watching a basketball game
on the couch.]
Monica: (entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?
(They ignore her.) Guys?
Chandler: (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Monica: All right? What’s going on?
(They all slowly turn around to reveal that they are giving themselves a facial.)
Monica: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls
alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)
Ross: Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger
looking skin!
Joey: Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Y’know, she could use a
little…(Whistles that she needs to do what they’re doing.) (Something happens on
the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)
EndMonica: Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m
engaged. (Points to her ring.)

The Cute Guy: Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to
talk to your friend.
Monica: Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)

The Cute Guy: (To Phoebe) I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Phoebe: I did, but that was really fun.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sitting in the chair.]
Joey: (pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! (He
then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a
bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I
didn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my
parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…
Rachel: I’m fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple
syrup award!
Joey: Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.
Rachel: What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo
bottle.
Joey: Really?
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: What award are you practicing for?
Rachel: Grammy, Best New Artist.
Joey: Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present
an award.
Rachel: Ohh that’s great!
Joey: Yeah!
Rachel: So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win.
Joey: (confused) What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?
Rachel: Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a
tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Joey: Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve
never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Rachel: Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably
your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna
look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s
sorta like… (Does it, you’ll have to see it.)
Joey: Hey! (Likes it.)
Rachel: Y’know?
Joey: You practice losing the Grammies too?
Rachel: Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Joey: Ah.
[Scene: Monica’s Restaurant Kitchen, she’s cooking as Phoebe enters.]
Phoebe: Oh hey!
Monica: Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?
Phoebe: Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and
then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and
touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)
Monica: Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.
Phoebe: (laughs) All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kiss
me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
Monica: And did he?
Phoebe: I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey
speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)
Monica: Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Phoebe: I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks
today and I’ve only had six.
Monica: Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with
Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Phoebe: You sound like a guy.
Monica: No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep with
anyone else." Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that
I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.
Phoebe: You’ll have a last kiss.
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Ross is helping Joey with his tie.]
Ross: Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Joey: Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Ross: There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
Joey: Whoa!
Rachel: (entering from her room) Whoa what?
Joey: Ross has a boyfriend.
Ross: I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my
classes who-who has a crush on me.
Rachel: Really?
Ross: Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (Rachel
and Joey both look at him.)
Rachel: Not right now.
Ross: It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Rachel: Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and
it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time
he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in
love.
Ross: Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: How’d you get over that teacher?
Rachel: I didn’t. I got under him.
Joey: (To Ross) Problem solved.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is saying good-bye to her boyfriend Jake at the door to
Central Perk.]
Jake: Bye Phoebe.
Phoebe: Okay bye. (They kiss.)
Jake: All right. Bye. (Backs out the door.)
Phoebe: Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye
at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Monica: Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me.
I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not
having that new relationship feeling…
Jake: (yelling through the window to Phoebe) I miss you already!!
Phoebe: (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
Monica: See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But
I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for
the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey
sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our
relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don’t you think?
Chandler: Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.

Commercial Break
[Scene: The 2001 Soapie Awards, the announcer is introducing the next presenter.]

Announcer: Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani
from Days of Our Lives. (Applause as Joey angrily walks to the podium and eyes the
trophy.)
Joey: (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for
this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head
in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff.
(There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live
Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of
the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives
Jessica Ashley. And the winner is…(Opens the envelope)…Jessica Ashley from Days
of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight so
I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And I’m sure
that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also
like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who’s
sittin’ right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is
turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Rachel are entering.]
Rachel: Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Joey: Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips out
the award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)
Rachel: Oh my God you stole her award!
Joey: No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the
TV to display it.)
Rachel: Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.
Joey: Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, "I behalfin’ it!"
Rachel: Joey, you have got to take this back!
Joey: But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she
didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Rachel: (looking at the award) No! Joey!
Joey: Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of
‘em.
Rachel: Do you really want an award you didn’t win?
Joey: No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those!
Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come
over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.
Rachel: Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Joey: I can scratch that right off.
Rachel: Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t
want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna
win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Joey: All right!
Rachel: All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.
Joey: I’ll take it back tomorrow.
Rachel: Thank you.
(He goes into his room and closes the door. Rachel goes to pick it up and…)
Joey: (opening his door) If I can’t have it you can’t have it! (Rachel
walks away angrily.)
[Scene: Ross’s Classroom, he is writing on the board and Alan is coming in to see
him.]
Lewis: Professor Geller?
Ross: (turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Lewis: I know I didn’t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda
hoping you could change my grade.
Ross: And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
Lewis: Because I’m in love with you.
Ross: (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
Lewis: Yeah, I’m all…in love with you and stuff. So could you change
my grade?
Ross: No!
Lewis: Well why not you changed Ned’s grade!
Ross: Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with
me!
Lewis: No he’s not! He’s totally yanking your chain! He’s done
this with three other teachers!
Ross: What?
Lewis: He’s got a girlfriend!
Ross: I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
Lewis: I know! It’s awful. I love you.
(Ross glares at him.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Monica enters.]
Monica: Have you seen Chandler?
Phoebe: No. Why?
Monica: ‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m
not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.
Phoebe: Okay, don’t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere
around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. (Points to a guy
sitting behind Monica.)
Monica: Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all
this.
Phoebe: No that is the last thing you want to do!
Monica: Why?
Phoebe: Because you’re marrying him!
Monica: You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Phoebe: All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been
married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears
or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
Monica: So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy
I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Phoebe: That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and
put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Monica: Your mother told you this?
Phoebe: Yes!
Monica: The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you
were 13?
Phoebe: Oh my God! You’re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell
Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean
putting out doesn’t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
[Scene: Silvercup Studios, Joey and Rachel are there to give Jessica her award.]
Rachel: I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Joey: Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Rachel: Okay, I’m totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)
Jessica Ashley: Come in.
(The enter.)
Joey: Hey Jessica.
Rachel: (coolly) Hey Jess.
Joey: Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Jessica Ashley: Hi.
Rachel: ‘Sup? (Joey glares at her.)
Joey: Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to
her.)
Jessica Ashley: (shocked) Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this
means?! (She rolls her eyes and throws it onto the couch.)
Joey: Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put
it on your self or anything?
Jessica Ashley: No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you’ll
excuse me. (She exits.)
Joey: (To Rachel) Take it back?
Rachel: Absolutely.
Joey: Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with
flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is talking to Chandler.]
Monica: Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would
like to talk about or share?
Chandler: Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Monica: You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at
all?
Chandler: Kinda. They’re really big.
Monica: Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never
gonna be with anybody new again?
Chandler: What?
Monica: Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers
me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the
first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?
Chandler: No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly
panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Monica: Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that
you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Chandler: Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even
more sweating.
Monica: Even with me?
Chandler: I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our
relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be
together for the rest of our lives.
Monica: Really?
Chandler: Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts,
I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports
drink.
Monica: Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you don’t have to worry.
No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first
time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…
Chandler: (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
[Scene: Ross’s classroom, he has just finished his lecture and the students are
filing out.]
Ross: Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Morse: (walking up) That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair
cut?
Ross: Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to
know that I’m changing your grade back.
Morse: What?! Why?
Ross: ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s
not gonna work.
Morse: I’m not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Ross: Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This
little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay—(Ned looks
shocked)—Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me
feel Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to
make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor
Fredrickson, I’ll be right with you. (To Ned) Don’t make this worse and
I’ll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)

EndMonica: I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
(Runs out.)
Rachel: (To Phoebe, after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!
Phoebe: Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds it
up.) We have a guest list!
Rachel: Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Phoebe: Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
[Scene: Ross's apartment, there is a knock on the door and Ross opens it to Cassie.]
Ross: (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
Cassie: Hey Ross!
Ross: Hey!
Cassie: (hugs him) It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting
up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Ross: Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed
like you didn’t.
Cassie: Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Ross: It’s okay. Come, come on in.
Cassie: Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice,
but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Ross: Oh.
(She sets down her bag and we travel back to slow motion world. She once again whips
her hair around in slow motion with the love doctor Barry White singing in the background.
And I’d also like to take this opportunity to mention that she can also be seen in Starship

few miles from where I live. Anyway Cousin Ross is now staring.)

Cassie: Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Ross: Yeah—No!!
Commercial Break
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Cassie is eating dinner and Ross is pacing behind her because
of what she’s eating.]
Ross: Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
Cassie: I’m all done.
Ross: (quietly) Thank God.
Cassie: I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented
that beach house together.
Ross: Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and
tickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now.
Cassie: I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all
of these freckles. (She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)
Ross: (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll
always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
Cassie: It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Ross: Well I’m, I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children
would be.
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment, it’s Monica’s bridal shower and Phoebe is passing
out some finger food.]
Phoebe: Hi!
Woman: Hi!
Phoebe: How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of
women.) Hi, thanks for coming.
Woman: Oh thank you.
(The other woman declines.)
Phoebe: Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to
another pairing.) Oh, it’s so nice to see you.
Woman: No.

The Other Woman: No thanks.
Phoebe: Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
Rachel: Yeah?
Phoebe: Who the hell are all these people?
Rachel: Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone
book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Phoebe: Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!
(A woman approaches.)
Rachel: (to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of
honor. How do you know Monica?
Woman: I was her accountant four years ago.
Rachel: Ohhhh!
Woman: I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxes
these last four years.
Rachel: That’s great!
Woman: So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?

Phoebe and Rachel: (to each other) I don’t know.
Rachel: (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You
didn’t tell her to come?!
Phoebe: You were supposed to tell her!
Rachel: No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was
supposed to bring the cake!
Phoebe: Fine, I’ll go call her.
Rachel: Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the counter as Monica enters carrying a
tray.]
Monica: Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to
try on.
Joey: Wow! This looks great!
Monica: Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is
made of bologna. (Points.)
Joey: And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Monica: Oh, just until the glue dries.
Joey: Thank God!
Monica: (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. 
Joey: Ah.
Monica: Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is
nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.
Joey: Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
Monica: I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just
for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and
try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.
Joey: Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
(He goes into his room to try them on and closes the door.)
Joey: Ow!
Monica: Toothpick?
Joey: Yeah.
Monica: What are you trying on now?
Joey: The fruit roll up.
Monica: And?
Joey: Delicious.
Monica: Joey!
Joey: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Monica: What?! Which one?!
Joey: The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!
(They hug.)
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Cassie and Ross are watching a movie and Cassie is pouring
Ross some more wine as Ross has his hands full with the glass and holding the bowl of
popcorn in his lap.]
Ross: (in his head) She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If
she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (She grabs
some popcorn.) Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who
suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She
was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She
grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I
want it. She wants it. I’m going in. 

(They exchange looks, smile, and shrug their shoulders before Ross suddenly lunges
forward in an attempt to kiss her, but she expertly backs away.)
Cassie: Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)
Ross: (in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesn’t
have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will
do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause)
There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To
her) I-I, I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his
head) Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.

[Scene: outside Phoebe's apartment, Monica is knocking on the door.]
Monica: Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need
me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel
sitting on the couch.) Oh.
Rachel: Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Monica: For what?
Rachel: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Phoebe: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Monica: You al-you already had it?
Phoebe: Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people
came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Rachel: Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now
you don’t have either.
Phoebe: We ruined everything.
Rachel: Ugh…
Monica: Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that was
really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Rachel: What do you, what do you mean?
Monica: Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I
mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk
to people I don’t even like!
(Suddenly, everyone stands up and comes out of hiding. All of them are glaring at
Monica.)
Rachel: Surprise…
Phoebe: Sur-surprise.
Rachel: …Monica.
[Scene: The casting director’s office, Joey is there to show off to the director,
so to speak.]
Joey: And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right? 
The Director: Yeah.
Joey: My whole family’s from Naples!
The Director: Oh that’s great! Okay, well I’ve heard everything I need
to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie…
The Casting Director: Joey, this is awkward part.
Joey: Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I
totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars
or tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands
back up and looks down.) So there you go, that’s me. (We cut to a camera angle
looking at the casting director and movie director through Joey’s legs.) One hundred
percent natural! (Suddenly, there’s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is
shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Ending Credits
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is getting out linens for Cassie who is in the
bathroom.]
Phoebe: Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Cassie: Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Phoebe: Oh! No problem! I… (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once
again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping
thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise
Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official
website at www.deniserichards.com.)
Cassie: (noticing her) What?
Phoebe: (in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s
not your cousin!

EndMonica: (Comes up for below the covers and
looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not
knowing what to say.)
[Cut to Chandler opening the door to his and Joey’s apartment to reveal Monica
standing there with a turkey on her head in The One With The Thanksgiving Flashbacks.]
Chandler: Nice try.
Monica: Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Chandler: Look, Monica…
Monica: Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Chandler: This is not going to work.
Monica: I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Chandler: You are so great! I love you!
(Monica stops suddenly and turns around slowly.)
Monica: What?
Chandler: Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!
Monica: You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Monica: Yes, you did!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Monica: You love me!
Chandler: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
(Joey walks in and sees Monica. He freaks out and runs back into the hallway,
screaming.)
[Cut to Chandler trying to hint to Monica that he wanted to move in with her in The One
After Vegas.]
Chandler:  Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Monica: Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Monica: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it
doesn’t make any sense.
Chandler: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m
saying?
[Cut to Chandler entering his and Monica’s apartment alight with a thousand
candles in The One With The Proposal.]
(He walks dejectedly into his apartment to find it lit with about a thousand candles
and Monica standing in the living room.)
Monica: You wanted it to be a surprise.
(He turns to look at Joey who smiles slyly and closes the door leaving them alone.)
Chandler: Oh my God.
(Monica gets down on one knee.)
Monica: Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.
(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a
reason why girls don’t do this!
Chandler: Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,
I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I
thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
(Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you
marry me?
Monica: Yes.
(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger. They hug and kiss this time as
an engaged couple.)
Joey: (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
Monica: Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
We’re engaged!!!
(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch as Joey and Ross enter.]
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Ross: Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because
Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Joey: How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Ross: How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
Phoebe: Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass,
‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.
Ross: I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!
Phoebe: Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten
marriages end in divorce?
Ross: Phoebe that’s not true.
Phoebe: Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?
Rachel: I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
Joey: (shocked) Has it been that long?!
Ross: Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
[Flashback to Joey interrupting a bath Monica and Chandler are sharing in The One With
All The Kissing. Monica dives underwater as Joey opens the door.]
(They move into kiss but are interrupted by Joey knocking on the door.)
Joey: Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
(Monica quickly dives under the water as Joey enters. He looks a little shocked at what
Chandler's doing.)
Chandler: I've had a very long, hard day.
Joey: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Chandler: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Joey: Okay.
(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)
Chandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken.
Monica: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler: Hey Joe!
(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)
Chandler: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke—(Yelps
in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.
(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)
[Cut back to Central Perk.]
Rachel: I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.
Joey: I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.
[This starts a series of flashbacks starting with Monica and Chandler forcing Joey to
keep his new found knowledge of their secret relationship in Monica’s bedroom in The
One With All the Kips.]
Joey: (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Monica: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Joey: How?! When?!
Chandler: It happened in London.
Joey: IN LONDON!!!

Chandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.
Joey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
(They both grab him and stop him.)
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell.
(Joey thinks it over.)
Joey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
[Cut to Rachel listening to a phone conversation between Chandler and Monica in The One
With All the Resolutions.]
Monica: (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm
gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Chandler: (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Monica: (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…
Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)
[Cut to Phoebe in Ross’s new apartment looking at Monica and Chandler and what
they’re about to do in The One Where Everybody Finds Out.]
Phoebe: (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts
yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes
off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Rachel: Oh my God!
Phoebe: CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!

Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe: OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!

Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!

Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe: YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop
screaming!!
Ross: (entering) What's going on?

Phoebe and Rachel: Ohhh!!!
Rachel: (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi! 
Ross: What?! What?!
Rachel: Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!
Ross: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Phoebe: (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)
(Ross starts jumping and screaming incoherently and hops over and joins in on the group
hug.)
[Cut to later in that episode in Central Perk, a meeting with Phoebe, Rachel, and Joey
where they discuss Chandler and Monica.]
Phoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel
knows?
Joey: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!
Phoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own
[Cut to later in that episode. Rachel and Phoebe are going to a movie from Monica and
Chandler’s, and as Phoebe walks by Chandler she pinches him on the butt and exits.]
Rachel: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica: Bye!
All: Bye!
Phoebe: Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)
Chandler: (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!
Monica: Actually, I did!
Chandler: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
[Cut to later in that episode. Monica and Chandler are confronting Joey in his
apartment about Phoebe’s knowledge.]
Chandler: Phoebe knows about us!
Joey: Well I didn't tell them!
Monica: Them?! Who's them?
Joey: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Monica: Joey!
Joey: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Monica: Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see
they don't know that we know that they know! So…
Chandler: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
[Cut to later in that episode. Phoebe is telling Rachel in Monica and Chandler’s
that Chandler wants to make a date with Phoebe.]
Phoebe: I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Rachel: Are you kidding?!
Phoebe: No!
Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?
Joey: No.
Rachel: Joey!
Joey: They know you know.
Rachel: Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Phoebe: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!
Joey: I couldn't even if I wanted too.
[Cut to later in that episode. Chandler is in his bathroom with Monica, and he’s
panicking on how far Phoebe is pushing him.]
Chandler: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her! 
Monica: She's bluffing!
Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)
[Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]
Phoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey: (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Rachel: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Joey: Ooh!
Rachel: Okay!
Joey: I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
Phoebe: Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.
Joey: It's not my first time.
[Cut to the bathroom.]
Monica: You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler: Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Monica: Of course.
[Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from
behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.]
Chandler: Oh, you're-you're going?
Phoebe: Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
Chandler: (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very
happy were gonna have all the sex.
Phoebe: You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
Chandler: Not if I kiss you first.
(They move closer to together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He
puts his hand on her left hip but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe
then grabs his butt. Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her
shoulder.)
Phoebe: Ooh.
Chandler: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Phoebe: Here it comes. Our first kiss.
(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her
eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a
short while and pushes Phoebe away.)
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Phoebe: And why not?!
Chandler: Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe: You're-you're what?!
(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)
Chandler: Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Monica: I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
Phoebe: I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!
Joey:  So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Monica: Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Chandler: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
[Cut to later in that episode. Ross is showing his boss his new place and notices
something in the window.]
Ross: (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Joey and Ross are talking.]
Phoebe: Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta
change things.
Rachel: You really think it would be that different?
Phoebe: How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having
kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo
dealership.
Rachel: Well, things change.
Joey: I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Ross: It’ll be okay Joe.
Joey: I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.
[Flashback to the gang in Central Perk in The One Where Nana Dies Twice, they’re
all going through an old photo album.]

Chandler’s. The girls gasp and groan and the guys laugh hysterically.
Phoebe: (To Monica) Oh, that’s beautiful.
Joey: (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! That’s good!
Rachel: (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?
(Ross laughs.)

Helena: No-no I heard! I’m just sorry.
Chandler: It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the
hotel.
(He gets up to walk out, but Helena spots and stops him.)
Helena: (to Chandler’s back) Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early
in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. (He slowly turns around.
Helena recognizes him.)
Monica: Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Joey enters strutting.]
Joey: Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe
that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
Phoebe: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Joey: Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Joey: The silk? Feels really good!
Phoebe: Huh.
Joey: Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they
were gonna be.
Phoebe: That’s great Joe!
Joey: Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with
men’s underwear!
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Joey: Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton,
silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?
Phoebe: Hmm?
Joey: Pantyhose! Y’know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way
up to here… (He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) I should go
take these off shouldn’t I?
Phoebe: I think it’s important that you do.
(Joey agrees and heads to take them off.)
[Scene: 4 Queens Club, scene continued from earlier.]
Helena: So what’s your name?
Chandler: (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
Helena: Chandler? What an unusual name! You must’ve had terribly fascinating
parents.
Chandler: Oh, they’re a hoot.
Helena: (To Monica) And who is your friend?
Monica: I’m-I’m Monica.
Helena: Monica! Where are you from?
Monica: New York.
Helena: I’m not very fond of New York. Queens I like. (Noticing
Monica’s ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who
woos.) Honey! Huh?
Chandler: Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Helena: Really?! Congratulations. When’s the big day?
Monica: (looks at Chandler) In…in two weeks.
Helena: (disappointed) I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of
happiness. (To a bald guy.) So you’re bald?
Chandler: Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
Helena: We? (Looks at Monica who nods.)
Chandler: I know it would make me happy, ma’am.
Helena: Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all
misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something. (Goes back on
stage.)
Monica: (To Chandler) You okay?
Chandler: Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Helena: Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom
how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall.
Fortunately, in my life… (Four guys wearing rubber boots, shorts, hats, and nothing
else carrying umbrellas run onto the stage.) (Singing) It’s raining men! 

The Chorus Line: Hallelujah! 

Helena: It’s raining men!

The Chorus Line: Amen!
Chandler: (To Monica) When I was growing up I…played the one on the far
left.
[Scene: The Porsche, cars are whizzing by and honking their horns on both sides very
quickly as Ross creeps along.]
Rachel: Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Ross: Who?
Rachel: Fourth gear!!
(Suddenly a siren goes off.)
Ross: What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
Rachel: Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two
o’clock position.
Ross: Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
(They pull over.)
Rachel: It’s a different guy!
(The policeman walks up.)
Ross: Good evening officer.
Policeman: Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
Ross: Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty.
Policeman: You’re right. It was 37. (Rachel laughs.)
Ross: I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are
ya?
Policeman: That’s right.
(There’s a pause as Ross gets suddenly flirtatious.)
Ross: Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
Rachel: Oh my God!
Policeman: Your license please.
Ross: (laughs) You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream
Officer…Pretty?
Policeman: It’s Petty. (He grabs Ross’s license.) I’ll be right
back with your ticket. (Walks back to his car.)
Rachel: (pause) You have a son!
Ross: I know. I know.
Ending Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is returning from having removed Rachel’s panties.]
Phoebe: Feel better?
Joey: Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my
manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right
now.
Phoebe: Yeah, I understand.
Joey: Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and
goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!
Woman: Hi!
Joey: Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Woman: I don’t think so.
Joey: Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days
of Our Lives.
Woman: Wow!
Joey: Yeah.
Woman: Really?!
Joey: Hm-mmm.
Waitress: (to the woman) $4.50 please.
Joey: Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with
it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.
EndChandler: Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that’s when I
uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)
Yeah, y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can’t be scary.
Phoebe: Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.
Chandler: But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give
Monica so she’d know I was okay.
Ross: Dude. (Hugs him.)
(Mr. Geller turns the corner.)
Mr. Geller: Way to go son! I knew you’d find him!
[Scene: The moment we waited for has finally arrived. It’s time for Monica and
Chandler’s wedding. We’ve got violins playing Every Breath You Take,
we’ve got guests seated, and Chandler starts walking down the aisle with his parents
on either arm.]
Mr. Bing: Our little boy is getting married.
Mrs. Bing: Oh look at you! So handsome!
Chandler: You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look
beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I’m so glad you
here. (He kisses his mom.)
(He walks up onto the altar and notices the rabbi.)
The Rabbi: Are you Chandler?
Chandler: Are you Joey?
(Ross walks down the aisle with Phoebe and Rachel on his arms.)
Ross: Huh. This is nice.
Phoebe: What?
Ross: I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in
divorce.
(Finally, Monica with her parents on her arms start down the aisle.)
Mrs. Geller: Oh I wish you’re grandmother had lived to see this.
Monica: She’s right there.
Mrs. Geller: Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on
the cheek.) Congratulations darling.
Mr. Geller: I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)
(Chandler steps off the altar to greet his bride-to-be.)
Chandler: You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
Monica: Not now.
Chandler: Okay.
(They both step up onto the altar and she notices the rabbi.)
Monica: (To Chandler) Who is this?
The Rabbi: I am Father Kalebasous.
Chandler: (in Monica’s ear) He’s Greek Orthodox.
Rachel: (leaning in) As are you…
The Rabbi: Let us begin. Dearly beloved…
Joey: (entering) That’s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I
can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I’m sorry I’m a little
late. You may be confused by this now, (He’s still in costume) but you won’t be
Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let’s get started before the groom takes off again.
Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man
and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a
long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now,
as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
(She turns to get her vows from Rachel.)
Monica: (To Rachel) He took off?
Rachel: Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
Monica: Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince,
my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.
And in stead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And
now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with
you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!
Joey: Chandler?
(Ross leans in to give Chandler his vows.)
Chandler: (To Ross) No, that’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I
thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I
saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises
that come our way it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was
meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? (He leans in and
kisses her.)
Joey: You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the
state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do
you take each other?
Chandler: I do.
Monica: I do.
Joey: Yeah you do!
Ross: Rings?
Joey: Aw crap! Okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings. 
(Chandler and Monica both turn, take the rings from Ross and Rachel respectively, and
place them on each other’s fingers.)
Joey: We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To
Chandler) Now kiss her again.
(They kiss and everyone applauds.)
Chandler: (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
Monica: What baby?
Chandler: Our baby.
Monica: We have a baby?
Chandler: Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Monica: I didn’t take a pregnancy test.
Chandler: Then…who did?
[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel.]
Phoebe: Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
(The camera zooms in on Rachel who has a very worried and frightened look on her face
and she slowly takes a deep breath.)
[Fade to black.]

Mona: So, is it my turn now?
(A large little fat girl walks over.)
Fat Girl: I’m next!
Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
Mona: Uh, that’s okay. You can dance with her first.
Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what’s
uh, what’s your name.
Fat Girl: Gert!
Ross: That’s, that’s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to
step on Ross’s feet, but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing there Gert?
Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
Gert: Why aren’t you moving your feet?
Ross: I’m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
Gert: Faster! You’re not going fast enough!
Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert’s shocked and Ross realizes
what he said and tries to brush it off.)
[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]
Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
Dennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
Joey: Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I
know you’re casting for this new show…
Dennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I don’t think you’re quite right for
this project.
Joey: Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it.
And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me.
Dennis Phillips: It’s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
Joey: Well I’m not proud of this, but… (He turns around and starts to
mess with his eyelids.)
Dennis Phillips: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please!
Don’t-don’t-don’t!
[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]
Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Chandler: Did it turn into sand?
Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. (She starts
to walk towards the floor.)
Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took
all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be
seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can
easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I
want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just
try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a
move.) There you go.
(Mr. Geller dances over.)
Mr. Geller: Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested.
Chandler: Why?
Mr. Geller: You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and
Chandler stops.)
[Scene: The Women’s Restroom, Rachel and Phoebe are waiting for the outcome of
Rachel’s second test.]
Rachel: How much longer?
Phoebe: 30 seconds.
Rachel: 30 seconds, okay.
Monica: (entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know
that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna…
Rachel: Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
Phoebe: It’s time.
(Another woman starts to enter.)

The Girls: No!! (The woman backs out.)
Monica: Go ahead Rach.
(She goes over to look.)
Rachel: Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I
can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
Phoebe: Okay.
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: Umm, it’s negative.
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: It’s negative.
Rachel: Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is—that’s
great—that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y’know ‘cause the whole not
being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way
it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.
Monica: Well… Well, great.
Phoebe: Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
Rachel: Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset
over something I never had? It’s negative?
Phoebe: No, it’s positive.
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive.
Rachel: Are you sure?
Phoebe: Well yeah, I lied before.
Rachel: Oh!
Monica: Oh God…
Phoebe: Now you know how you really feel about it.
Rachel: Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!
Monica: Are you really gonna do this?
Rachel: Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m
gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)
Phoebe: With who?
Rachel: Ah, it’s still not the time.

Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler have gone through the phone book and
found Greg and Jenny’s number which Monica has just dialed.]
Monica: (on phone) Hello Greg? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica from the plane?
Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5… (Listens) (To Chandler) That is their old
number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!
Chandler: Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Monica: (on phone) Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next
Saturday? (Listens) Okay, how about Sunday? (Listens) Okay umm, the week after that?
(Listens) The week after that? (Listens) Y’know what Greg? Y’know what? We are

Jenny can’t see that then… (Listens) January 15th? (Chandler dances.)
We’ll see you then! (Listens) Okay! 
(She hangs up the phone and they hug.)
EndMonica: Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Ross: Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The
only reason I joined…
Will: Co-founded!
Ross: …co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love
with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I
Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Will: Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
Rachel: Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say
mean things about me?
Will: Well, we did a little more than that.
Ross: No-no! No-no. No-no.
Phoebe: What?! What else did you do?
Will: We started a rumor.
Rachel: What rumor?
Phoebe: Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Rachel: Ross!
Ross: It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that
umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
Rachel: What?!
Will: That’s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise
you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God!
Monica: You started that?!
Rachel: What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
Monica: Everyone at our school heard it!
Chandler: Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite
cheerleader from Long Island?!
Rachel: Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This
is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay
in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)
Ross: Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our
fault.
Rachel: Monica, how come you never told me this?!
Monica: I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and
then show it to me.
(Joey is now looking at Rachel, and since Rachel’s standing and he’s sitting
down and he’s not looking at her face… You get the picture.)
Rachel: Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!
Joey: I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.
Rachel: Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
[Time Lapse, dinner has ended for everyone except Joey who looks like to have finished
the turkey, until he turns the plate around and reveals he only ate one side.]
Joey: You are my Everest.
Monica: Joey, you don’t have to finish that.
Joey: Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who
can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar,
wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change
my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)
Rachel: (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote
in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you’re such a good person." Not
girl! Person!
Ross: Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.
Rachel: (reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, you’re a great
person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)
Ross: Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the
entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!
Rachel: Yes!
Will: Could you also tell them I’m skinny now?
Monica: Oh! Me too!
Ross: Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million
years ago!
Rachel: I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half
and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in
high school.
Monica: That’s not totally true.
Rachel: What?
Ross: What?
Monica: Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.
Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
Ross: (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
Monica: It’s true?!!
Ross: No.
Rachel: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
(Ross is at a loss for words.)
Will: Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went
back to Thailand.
Chandler: I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a
50-year-old woman?
Ross: Hey! She didn’t look 50!
Chandler: Did she look 16?
Rachel: Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Phoebe: Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
Ross: She didn’t photograph well!
Chandler: Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent
most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Phoebe: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird
dinner?
Ross: I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of
us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must
know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…
Monica: Didn’t she walk with a cane?
Ross: Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told
people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the
club!
Will: Yeah! (They high-five.)
Phoebe: I wanna join!
Rachel: Wh—Phoebe!!
Phoebe: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I
didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn
French. Bonjour.
Rachel: All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club,
but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!
You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)
Monica: All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that
rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.
One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Rachel: Wow…
Monica: And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in
high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Ross: As a romancer of the elderly.
Monica: Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be
pretty.
Ross: The eyes…did still sparkle.
Monica: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been
through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff
going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?
Rachel: She’s right.
Ross: Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Will: Hold on! You got her pregnant?
Ross: Yeah.
Will: Are ya getting married?
Ross: Nope.
Will: So you knocked her up but you’re not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wants
another high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?
Phoebe: Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined
it would be.
Joey: (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right
where’s that turkey!
Phoebe: Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Joey: Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Closing Credits

finish the turkey.]
Joey: Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come
the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
Monica: Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.
Chandler: Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Phoebe: Is there anything we can do for you?
Joey: No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Rachel: You can keep those pants by the way.
(Joey notices Monica has gotten a pie.)
Joey: Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Monica: Yeah, you want some?
Joey: Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)
A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the
knife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
EndRachel: (coming from her room) Hi, sweetie.

Joey: (thinking) Hey, it’s your girlfriend, Rachel!

Joey: Yeah.

Chandler: Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.

Joey: You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a
favor, this conversation was between you and me.

Chandler: If that.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch. Ross sits down.]

Rachel: Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment
tomorrow!

Ross: Right.

Phoebe: Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?

Ross: No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is
that it’s happy and healthy.

Rachel: Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!

Ross: And smart!

Rachel: Popular.

Ross: With an aptitude for science.

Phoebe: Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking
of names yet?

Rachel: Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!

Ross: Really? Me too!

Phoebe: Me too!

Rachel: Really?!

Phoebe: Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!

Ross: Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach,
what were you thinking? (Gives her a look)

Rachel: Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s
French.

Ross: Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.

Rachel: Okay fine, what do you have?

Ross: Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there,
but…Darwin.

Rachel: Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.

Phoebe: Yeah, by Sandrine.

Ross: You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!

Rachel: I’m really, really not.

Phoebe: How-how about you each get five vetoes?

Ross: All right.

Rachel: All right.

Ross: That sounds fair.

Rachel: Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check
this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.

Ross: Veto.

Rachel: Why?

Ross: Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out
of wheat.

Phoebe: I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!

Ross: Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?

Rachel: Ross, why do you hate our child?

Ross: Fine, you go.

Rachel: Okay, James.

Ross: Huh.

Rachel: But only if it’s a girl.

Ross: Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?

Rachel: Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?

Ross: Veto. Stewart?

Rachel: Veto. Sawyer?

Ross: Veto. Helen?

Rachel: Veto.

Phoebe: Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s, Monica comes from the bathroom as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hey.

Monica: Boy, do I have a surprise for you!

Chandler: Sex on the balcony?

Monica: No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?

Chandler: What is it?

Monica: I drew you a bath!

Chandler: Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having
sex on the balcony?

Monica: Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff!
I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got
you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!

Chandler: Well, this does butch it up a bit.

Monica: I swear, if you try it, you will love it!

Chandler: All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?

Monica: Absolutely.
(Chandler runs into the bathroom)

Monica: Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.
[Cut to Chandler laying in the bathtub. "Only Time," is playing in the
background.]

Chandler: (thinking) All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower
smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.

Monica: (entering) So?

Chandler: Oh my God.

Monica: I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you
a facial!

Chandler: I’m going to need a bigger boat.
[Scene: The Doctor’s Office, the doctor is writing something as Rachel is on the
table, and Ross is standing.]

Ross: I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on,
little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?

Rachel: Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!

Dr. Long: Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing
the sex of the baby?

Ross: Uh, no. No, we’re not.

Rachel: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether
it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?

Dr. Long: That’s right. But if you don’t want to know…

Ross: No, no, we want to wait, right?

Rachel: Right. Right.

Dr. Long: (looks at her beeping pager) Oh, I’ll be right back. And, uh, I know
it’s really not my place, but please don’t name your child Phoebo.

Rachel: (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of these
babies do you think is the ugliest?

Ross: What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible!
They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.

Rachel: Third one from the left?

Ross: Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.
(Rachel starts to peek at the file) Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!! 

Rachel: What?! 

Ross: You’re looking!

Rachel: I didn’t!

Ross: I saw you!

Rachel: Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.

Ross: Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

Rachel: Okay, but Ross just listen to me…

Ross: No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!

Rachel: But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I
swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary
lapse.

Ross: Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?

Rachel: (holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
[Scene: Chandler and Monica’s, Monica is entering.]

Monica: Hello?

Chandler: I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s
something wrong.

Monica: You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here. 

Chandler: I’m in the bathtub.

Monica: Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What’s wrong?

Chandler: I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt
didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t
compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!

Monica: What?

Chandler: The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.
(Pause) It’s interesting.

Monica: Okay, let’s talk about something else.

Chandler: Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!

Monica: Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking
about rules and right and wrong and…

Chandler: I had the exact same conversation.

Monica: You did? What was he talking about?

Chandler: I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out
words since we saw him in Macbeth!

Monica: (groans) That was a long night.

Chandler: All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?

Monica: Okay, he was talking about rules.

Chandler: Uh-huh.

Monica: Umm, and looking at people differently.

Chandler: He didn’t say anything about that to me.

Monica: What did he tell you?

Chandler: He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of
course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.

Monica: Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants
to do what you and I did in London with someone.

Chandler: But what did he mean by rules?

Monica: Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!

Chandler: Because he was looking at her differently.

Monica: And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!

Chandler: My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!

Phoebe: (from outside the bathroom) You guys?

Monica: Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!

Chandler: You don’t say anything.

Monica: Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the
greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all
start having babies?

Chandler: I’m not going to let you say anything.

Monica: You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)

Chandler: Oh, God!
(Monica runs out to Phoebe, who is in the kitchen)

Phoebe: Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.

Monica: Oh, you had that? 

Phoebe: Uh-huh.

Monica: I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.

Phoebe: Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
(Monica starts smiling)

Phoebe: What?

Monica: Nothing.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not
supposed to.

Phoebe: Fine.

Monica: It’s a humdinger!

Phoebe: Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.

Monica: Somebody likes you!

Phoebe: (Groans) Is it Chandler?

Monica: No!

Phoebe: Well, then tell him to stop staring!

Monica: It’s Joey!

Phoebe: Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.

Monica: Is it something you’d be interested in?

Phoebe: I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean,
on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I
can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.

Monica: I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?

Phoebe: Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt.
Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!

Monica: Not Chandler, just Joey.

Phoebe: Sure.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central perk, Ross is sitting on the chair as Rachel walks in.]

Rachel: Hey.

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming
around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.

Ross: Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a
minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind?
Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You
know it’s a boy!

Rachel: I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.

Ross: I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to
name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath
or Blaine or Sequoia.

Rachel: I would—Sequoia?

Ross: Veto.

Rachel: Fine.

Ross: Unless… (Rachel groans.) You anticipated that I would figure all
this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named
Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!

Rachel: But Ross, you want the name Ruth!

Ross: Not like this!
[Scene: Rachel and Joey’s, Joey is sitting on his recliner as Phoebe enters.]

Phoebe: Hey.

Joey: Hey. Well, what’s up?

Phoebe: Umm, Joey, I know.

Joey: What?

Phoebe: I knooow.

Joey: Whaaat?

Phoebe: I know about your feelings.

Joey: Oh my God. You do?

Phoebe: Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and
Monica, but that’s very rare.

Joey: I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those
guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.

Phoebe: For God sakes, it’s Rachel!

Joey: I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant
friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!

Phoebe: Yeah that’s Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it.

Joey: What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of
these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I
don’t like about her. You want to hear it?

Phoebe: Yeah.

Joey: She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And,
you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!

Phoebe: Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is
probably just a crush.

Joey: You think?

Phoebe: Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes
away.

Joey: Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m
Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.

Phoebe: That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know
I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure
you’ve had them for us.

Joey: Not really.

Phoebe: Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is on the couch as Ross enters.]

Ross: So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.

Rachel: What?

Ross: That’s right. The student has become the master.

Rachel: Ross, I swear, I don’t know.

Ross: Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!

Rachel: A what?!

Ross: You really didn’t know?

Rachel: We’re having a girl?

Ross: No.

Rachel: That’s what you just said!

Ross: No.

Rachel: You said girl!

Ross: Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

Rachel: I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe
it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!

Ross: I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!

Rachel: Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…

Ross: Permission to veto.

Rachel: Yes, please.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s, Chandler enters as Monica comes from the bathroom.]

Monica: Hey.

Chandler: Do I smell essential oils?

Monica: Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.

Chandler: Okay.
(As soon as Monica leaves the room, Chandler takes off his jacket and runs to the
bathroom. Monica enters the bathroom to find Chandler in the bathtub.)

Monica: What do you think you’re doing?

Chandler: L-leaving my troubles behind?

Monica: I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable
bath decorum.

Chandler: Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.

Monica: Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re
just a girl in a tub!
(Phoebe enters the bathroom)

Chandler: (upset) Hey!

Phoebe: Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know
how it went with Joey.

Chandler: (To Monica) You told her?!

Monica: She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard!
How’d it go?

Phoebe: Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and
told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t
like you? How would you feel?

Monica: (Pause) I don’t think I’d care.

Phoebe: Really? Lee Majors is hot!

Joey: (from outside the bathroom) Hello?

Phoebe: We’re in the bathroom!

Joey: Why?

Chandler: (sarcastically) Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!

Joey: (entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?

Monica: Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong.
It’s Rachel!

Chandler: You like Rachel?!

Joey: It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a
crush! It’s going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles!
Oh!

Phoebe: (checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.

Rachel: (entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in
here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be
replaced.)

Monica: Honey, cover it up with the boat!

Ross: (from outside the bathroom) Hello?

Chandler: (sarcastically) Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to
join us!

Ross: (entering) Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh, cool boat—(Sees why the
boat’s there)—Oh, no. (Averts his eyes by looking around the room) (To Rachel)
Hey, did you, did you tell them?

Rachel: No, I was waiting for you!

Phoebe: Tell us what?

Rachel: We’re having a girl.

All: Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
(They all hug and then turn and look at Chandler)

Chandler: I’ll…I’ll get you later!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel’s, Joey is sitting at the counter eating Cocoa Puffs.]

Joey: (thinking) All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a
crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing,
that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it
was cuckoo!" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.

Rachel: (entering) Hi, sweetie.

Joey: (thinking) I love you.

Closing Credits

[Scene: Chandler and Monica’s bathroom. Both are sitting on opposite ends of the
bathtub.]

Monica: It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?

Chandler: Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.

Monica: I’m not touching you.

Chandler: You’re not?

Monica: It’s the salts.

Chandler: Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!

Monica: (To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
EndRachel: Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!

Phoebe: Oh, you, too.

Joey: Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?

Rachel: It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all
day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the
Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh, thank you. I’ll see
you guys later.

Phoebe: Okay.

Joey: Bye.
(Rachel exits with coffee)

Joey: There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.

Phoebe: (sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?

Joey: Thanks. But maybe later.

Phoebe: Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?

Gunther: (to Joey) You want anything?

Joey: You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I
love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment
of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!

Gunther: We have red bagels.

Joey: Oh, okay. 
Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s. Phoebe and Ross are sitting in the living room
talking.]

Phoebe: So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?

Ross: Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been
away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so
supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my
friends.’

Phoebe: Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.

Ross: Uh, I’m going to take off.

Phoebe: All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!

Ross: What is it?

Phoebe: It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back
to your apartment?

Ross: All right. (reading the label) ‘Candy and Cookie?’

Phoebe: Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The
father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?

Monica: (entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, c’mere. I want to
show you something in the bathroom.

Phoebe: Oh, Monica, grow up!

Ross: Hey, what’s behind your back?

Monica: Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for
Valentine’s Day.

Ross: You don’t want my opinion?

Monica: Not really.

Ross: Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!

Monica: All right, big brother. (holds up two erm…revealing articles of
clothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your
best friend would want to do her?

Ross: (quietly) The red one.
[Scene: Joey and…wait…just Joey’s. Joey is sitting at the counter eating
a pizza.]

Phoebe: (knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed
lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real,
live, furry playmate.

Joey: No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
(Phoebe goes into the hall and brings a dog inside!)

Phoebe: He-hee!

Joey: Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.

Phoebe: This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!

Joey: Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we
are! (the dog sticks his head between Joey’s legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s. Chandler enters with a bouquet of roses.]

Chandler: Happy Valentine’s!

Monica: (from her bedroom) Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into
something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.

Chandler: (picking up a video from the table) ‘Candy and Cookie’.
‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must
love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some
"porn")
(A woman on TV breaths hard)

Man on TV: Yeah, just relax.

Chandler: I love you, St. Valentine.
(The woman groans, moans, grunts, and screams. Chandler’s eyes get huge!)

Chandler: Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!

Man on TV: Now, push!

Woman on TV: Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!

Chandler: Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on
the remote control, frantically.)

Woman on TV: Ohhh! Make it stop!

Chandler: I am trying!
[Scene: Joey’s. Joey is playing fetch with the dog.]

Joey: Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it,
but really doesn’t, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you’re cute, but
you’re not too smart! 
(The dog returns with a ball that looks exactly like the same one Joey has.)

Joey: (looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?

Rachel: (entering) Hi.

Joey: Hi.

Rachel: I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who
is this?

Joey: Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I
don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.

Rachel: (talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do to
a baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!)
Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go to
work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do.
(still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)

Joey: (to the dog) C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s
the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we
can’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re a
guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s. Chandler is sitting on the couch staring at the
tape on the coffee table with his eyes huge and his mouth wide open.]

Monica: (entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)
(Chandler glances up at Monica with his mouth still wide open and his eyes still huge)

Monica: (to herself) I’ve still got it!

Chandler: (pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?

Monica: What is it?

Chandler: It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…

Monica: Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s.
Why were you even watching it?

Chandler: I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.

Monica: Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s
Day… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, it’s about a
young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having
sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those
aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?

Chandler: Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.

Monica: Honey, what’s going on?

Chandler: Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?

Monica: Mm-hmm.

Chandler: How long it took to go back in the water?

Monica: Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!

Chandler: You don’t know. You didn’t see it.

Monica: Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.

Chandler: Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up
the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like
he’s going to throw up!)

Monica: Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!

Chandler: See, honey, there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)

Monica: Don’t touch me!
[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is sitting on the couch reading a magazine as Mona enters.]

Mona: Hi!

Ross: Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?

Mona: Good.

Ross: Yeah?

Mona: I brought you back a present.

Ross: Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! (Mona
laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea
water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not
interesting.

Mona: I think it’s interesting.

Ross: I do too! I missed you!

Mona: I missed you, too! So, how was your week?

Ross: Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!

Mona: How exciting!

Ross: Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around
when it happened for the first time.

Mona: Oh no.

Ross: Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested
Rachel move in with me.

Mona: (laughing) Yeah right!

Ross: What?

Mona: Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have your
ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’ (she laughs again)

Ross: (not amused) Huh…uh-huh.

Mona: Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my
boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant! (Mona laughs…yes…again!)
(Ross fake laughs, obviously not finding this funny, and he’s starting to panic,
so he shoves the whole saltwater taffy he’s eating in his mouth)

Mona: So, what’d you tell him?

Ross: (with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and
starts to break down)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk. Ross and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]

Phoebe: How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?

Ross: I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus,
she, uh, she got me taffy!

Phoebe: Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.

Ross: Ever?!

Phoebe: Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide
saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to
tell her?

Ross: Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know,
I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic
stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then
I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.

Phoebe: If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where
are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the
taffy, which she’s been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food?
What’s the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?
[Scene: Joey’s. Joey is laying on his recliner, depressed, and the dog is laying
on the footrest.]

Joey: So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just
isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!

Joey: Hey.

Phoebe: Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog?
(the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?

Joey: No.

Phoebe: Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.

Joey: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!
(Joey follows Phoebe into the kitchen)

Phoebe: He’s miserable! What happened to him?

Joey: Nothing. We just talked about stuff.

Phoebe: What stuff?

Joey: Rachel stuff.

Phoebe: Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world,
and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!

Joey: He’s breathing!

Phoebe: Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.

Joey: No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball)
Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces
right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the
dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
[Scene: Ross and…Rachel’s…I guess I have to call it that now. Rachel is
reading on the couch as Ross enters.]

Ross: Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?

Rachel: Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food
on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!

Ross: Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with
seawater, when in fact—

Rachel: Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
(There is a knock on the door.)

Rachel: Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her
money)

Ross: (opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are—hi! What
are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!

Mona: Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!

Ross: (he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of
like…)Ayyyayyyy!

Rachel: (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!

Mona: Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! (to Ross) What’s she doing here?

Ross: I have no idea!

Rachel: I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)

Mona: Seriously, what is she doing?

Ross: Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.

Mona: Why?

Ross: I think she’s lonely.

Mona: Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!

Ross: I know.

Mona: Can’t we just ask her to go?

Ross: No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
(Doorbell rings)

Rachel: I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!

Mona: Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?

Ross: Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.

Rachel: You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and
eat this in bed! (exits)

Ross: And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh,
open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.

Mona: You got another ex-wife back there?

Ross: (fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)

Rachel: (entering) I’m just going to grab the phone.

Mona: Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but,
but, um… what are you doing?

Rachel: Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?

Mona: No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment,
and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place and
give us some privacy?

Rachel: (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.

Ross: (handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to
remember me by.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch still
staring at the screen.]

Monica: How long has it been this time?

Chandler: 90 seconds.

Monica: That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about
it…except all I did was think about it.

Chandler: You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was
my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that
my screensaver!

Monica: Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape
and pretend it never existed?

Chandler: I can do that.

Monica: Okay.
(Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion)

Chandler: Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
(Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they can’t do it and
back up. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone
knocks on the door.)

Monica: Oh, thank God!

Chandler: Oh, I know!

Monica: Come in!

Rachel: (entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but
I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.

Monica: Oh, my God.

Chandler: Poor Ross.
(Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the
action in Ross’ apartment)

Chandler: Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he
closes the drapes!

Monica: Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.

Chandler: Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.

Rachel: Why? You saw it? Is it scary?

Chandler: Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being
born can make you want to kill yourself.

Rachel: Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch
it with me.

Monica: No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!

Rachel: C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch
this alone!

Monica: She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.

Chandler: (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This
reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all
sit down) Okay, here we go.

Rachel: Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts
screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!

Chandler: Why have I seen this thing three times?!

Monica: It’s…still beautiful.

Rachel: Uh! It’s horrible!

Monica: I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!

Rachel: Oh, my God!
(Monica and Rachel both cover their eyes)

Chandler: Wait, you guys, look!

Rachel: What? Did her ass explode?!

Chandler: No, the baby’s out! Look, look!

Monica: Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!

Chandler: And look how happy the mom is now!

Monica: Oh…Rach!

Rachel: Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!
[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee as Joey comes from…God knows where!
Some back area of Central Perk around the corner that we’ve never seen!
Weeeiiirrrddd….]

Ross: Hey, hey, man!

Joey: Hey, what’s up?

Ross: Uh…Mona just dumped me.

Joey: Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?

Ross: Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t
exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel
pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I
lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner, you know?

Joey: Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.

Ross: Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date
on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?

Joey: Sort of.

Ross: Really?!

Joey: You don’t have to seem so happy about it.

Ross: Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.

Joey: Oh, I…I d—

Ross: Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually
once—once I got dumped during sex.
(Two girls sitting at a table next to them look up in disgust, and Ross and Joey move
away)

Ross: Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?

Joey: Forget about it. It’s no big deal.

Ross: C’mon! Joey! What is it?

Joey: It’s nothing.

Ross: Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?

Joey: Okay, uh…sit down. (they do) Um… there’s this woman that I
like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.

Ross: She’s not a Tribbiani?

Joey: No!

Ross: I knew it. So, is she someone from work?

Joey: Yes.

Ross: Well, uh, does she like you?

Joey: Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I
can’t do anything about it.

Ross: Why not?

Joey: Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time.
Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really
good friends.

Ross: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love
with her?

Joey: No. I don’t think so.

Ross: Okay. Um… is he a good guy?

Joey: Yeah, he’s the best.

Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.

Joey: Oh, I don’t know.

Ross: Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.

Joey: I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep,
I—

Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen
to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.

Gunther: (placing a cup in front of Ross) Here’s your warm milk.

Ross: I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it
at home.

Joey: Oh, yeah.

Ross: Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And
tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)

Joey: It’s Rachel.
(Ross just stands in the doorway, for like a minute…Ahh! What’s going to
happen next??!!! I can’t make it all the way through the Olympics!!!)

Closing Credits

[Scene: Ross and Rachel’s. Rachel is standing in front of the TV holding a video.]

Rachel: (thinking) You’re going to have a baby, and you need to be
prepared. Now, you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
(Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)

Woman on TV: I came to the big city to become a star! I’ll do…anything to
make that happen!

Man on TV: Anything?
(Music starts playing…yes…you know what kind of music…)

Rachel: (thinking) Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.

EndRoss: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?

Joey: Yeah, he’s the best.

Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.

Joey: Oh, I don’t know.

Ross: Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.

Joey: I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep,
I—

Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen
to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until…)

Joey: It’s Rachel.
[Fade to Black, then fade in again with Ross stopped at the doorway.]
Ross: (closes the door) Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say
it’s Rachel?
Joey: Yes.
Ross: Um, you…you like Rachel?
Joey: Yes. I like Rachel.
Ross: Rachel?!
Joey: (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know,
y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.
Ross: But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 
Joey: Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.
Ross: It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what
about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t
stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?
Joey: I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over
dramatic.
Ross: Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
Joey: Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but
it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just
feelings, they’re gonna go away.
Ross: Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
Joey: Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
Ross: (stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?! 
(He exits and starts to walk away, passes a window, stops, and says
"Rachel?!" again. Joey sighs and turns around to face Gunther.)
Gunther: Rachel?!!
Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Chandler are on the couch.]
Rachel: Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!
Chandler: Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.
Rachel: Whoa!!
Chandler: Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
Rachel: Wow that was a big one.
Chandler: I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Phoebe: (entering) Oh hey you guys!
Chandler: Oh hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Rachel: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there
for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why
I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?
Chandler: No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each
other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.
Phoebe: Okay, good.
Chandler: Why?
Phoebe: Well last night, I met Monica’s.
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other
half.
Chandler: Come on, don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think
there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at
him.)
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Well, what’s he like?!
Phoebe: Well he’s tall.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: He has brown hair.
Rachel: Of course, of course.
Chandler: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Phoebe: He works with food!
Rachel: Oh sure. Older?
Phoebe: Obviously, and he’s British.
Rachel: Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Phoebe: Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
Rachel: Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Chandler: Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re
talking about.
Phoebe: Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I
but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.
Chandler: You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re
still gonna date him?
Phoebe: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross is opening the door to Monica.]
Monica: Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Monica: I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.
Ross: Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I
mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!
Monica: All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,
but don’t say that again.
Ross: Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the
stepfather of my child.
Monica: Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about!
First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if
he did you have no idea how she’d react.
Ross: Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a
virgin.
Monica: Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Ross: He’s not?
Monica: No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean,
listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.
Ross: Why?
Monica: He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
Ross: Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just
it’s Rachel, y’know?
Monica: Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I
don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that
you’re still his friend.
Ross: Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.
Monica: All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars
into Vermont money.
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are on the couch as Phoebe enters with
Monica’s soul mate.]
Phoebe: Oh! Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Phoebe: Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Don: Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandler’s hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monica’s
hand.)
Phoebe: (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
Chandler: (mouths to Phoebe) What?
Phoebe: (cough talks) Soul mate.
Monica: So, what have you guys been doing?
Don: Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the
sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
Monica: I know! What is this, 1985?!
Don: That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange.
Monica: Not really.
Chandler: What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)
On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?
Monica: So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Don: Well, Octavio, 27&7—Oh! And there’s this great little place,
Alessandro’s.
Monica: Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.
Don: You’re kidding me!
Monica: No!
Don: Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu,
once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Monica: Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna
talk about me, I’m gonna go with you. 
(They go over to the counter and Chandler moves closer to Phoebe.)
Chandler: What are you doing?!
Phoebe: Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And
the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…
Chandler: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Phoebe: They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think
they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.
Monica: (returning) Phoebe, good work.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Monica: Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at
Phoebe.)
Phoebe: Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.
[Scene: Joey’s Apartment, there’s a knock on the door and Joey answers it to
Ross.]
Joey: Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Joey: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Ross: No, I don’t want to hit you.
Joey: Oh what then? Kick me?
Ross: No.
Joey: (getting worried) Bite me?
Ross: No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to
tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I
just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
Joey: Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or
something?
Ross: Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)
Joey: Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel
left. I don’t…
Ross: Okay.
Joey: (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something
okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do
anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)
Ross: Thank you.
(They clink glasses and take a drink. Ross likes it, Joey hates it. Then Ross sees Joey
hating it, mimics he hates it as well.)
Joey: Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over
her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been
in love before so…
Ross: What?! You’re in love with her.
Joey: Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Ross: Umm, no.
Joey: Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I
just keep thinking, "Ah, I’ll get over this." Y’know? I just—It
just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know?
What do I do?
(Pause)
Ross: I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Joey: Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.
Ross: No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if
she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
Joey: But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…
Ross: If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it
shouldn’t stand in the way.
Joey: Are you sure?
Ross: Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is
she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
Joey: Hey thanks.
Ross: So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
Joey: Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I
will say. What should I say?
Ross: I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.
Joey: I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another
sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!
Ross: Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys
another sip.)
Commercial Break
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Chandler are watching Monica and Don talk.]
Don: …so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing
more on the cheese side of things.
Chandler: Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Don: Excuse me?
Chandler: Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Don: Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who
thinks the smellier the better.
Monica: Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me
to have blue cheese in the house.
Don: And you’re still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries
to but fails.)
Monica: You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.
Ah, and pastries… (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s
just I used to be fat.
Don: Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a
great little villa you can stay at.
Chandler: Is it made of cheese?
Don: No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!
Monica: I’d move in tomorrow!
Chandler: (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
Phoebe: I’m so sorry.
Chandler: What do we do?
Phoebe: I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I
don’t know how you fight that.
[Scene: Outside Ross and Rachel's, Joey walks up to knock on the door, but stops.]
Joey: Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand
up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as
Rachel opens the door and startles him.)
Rachel: Joey? What’s up?
Joey: I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Rachel: Okay what’s up?
Joey: Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Rachel: Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Joey: Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with
you tonight. That’s all.
Rachel: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to
meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
Joey: Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what
you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles
Joey again.) Don’t you people ever knock?!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are entering.]
Monica: I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?
Chandler: Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here,
browsing through the personals.
Monica: Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.
Chandler: Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Monica: Jeez! What is with you?
Chandler: I’m sorry, did you say cheese?
Monica: All right, what’s going on?
Chandler: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in
that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in
your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Monica: Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?
Chandler: No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
Monica: I don’t believe in soul mates either.
Chandler: You don’t?
Monica: No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together.
I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really
hard.
Chandler: So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Monica: No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard
that would be to clean?
Chandler: I love you.
Monica: I know.
Chandler: Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I
found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica
doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are having dinner.]
Rachel: …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he
touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.
(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?
Joey: What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…(Exhales
slowly)—Is it hot in here?
Rachel: No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?
Joey: I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin
doing Hobbs.
Rachel: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Joey: Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater
out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
Rachel: Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.
Joey: Uh… How long have we known each other?
Rachel: Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Joey: Uh-huh, long time.
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: But over the past few weeks…
(A waiter runs over interrupting Joey.)
Waiter: Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a
couple specials tonight…
Joey: Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Waiter: Sure. Sure. (Turns away, then turns back) Second’s up! (Joey glares
at him.) Not…that kind of table. (He walks away.)
Rachel: So you were saying?
Joey: I’m not quite sure.
Rachel: Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I
said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and
umm…now here we are.
Joey: Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love
with you.
Rachel: (stunned) What?
Joey: I’m falling in love with you.
Rachel: (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! Oh,
it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey
doesn’t say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay.
Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?
Joey: Does it really matter?
Rachel: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.

You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,
you gotta say something!
Rachel: Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…
Joey: But. (Hangs his head down.)
Rachel: Joey.
Joey: Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh,
pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think
I’m gonna go. (Stands up.)
Rachel: No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this!
Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)
Joey: Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then
you’re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to
her.)
Rachel: Can I? (Hug him.)

[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are still hugging as a waiter walks by the table
to talk to the annoying waiter from before who is watching.]
Waiter No. 2: Is this your table?
Waiter: Yeah.
Waiter No. 2: God, you’re gonna be here all night!
Waiter: I know! I haven’t even read them the specials yet!
Waiter No. 2: What’s the matter with them?
Waiter: I don’t know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kinda
hope it’s the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!
EndRachel: No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that
up!
Joey: What?! Why?!
Rachel: So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be
awkward!
Joey: And you couldn’t think of anything else?!
Monica: You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Rachel: (To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss!
I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
Chandler: You can always sell your baby.
Rachel: Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m
gonna get fired!
Joey: You lied to me!
Rachel: Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
Monica: Chandler has two copies of Annie!
[Scene: Mona’s Apartment, she and her date are making out as Ross flips through a
magazine while lying behind the couch and sees something that he likes. Meanwhile,
Mona’s date takes off Ross’s shirt and Mona throws it on the floor. While they
start making out again, Ross tries to pull the rug the shirt is on over to him, but while
he does that he moves the coffee table and it bumps into the couch.]
Mona: (seeing Ross) Oh my God! Ross!!!
Ross: Hello!!
Mona: Ross, what are you doing?!
Ross: Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
[Scene: Mr. Zelner’s Office, Rachel is knocking on the door.]

Mr. Zelner: Please, come in. Have a seat. (She does so.)
Rachel: Okay look Mr. Zelner…
Mr. Zelner: Oh I think it’s best that I speak first.
Rachel: Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
Mr. Zelner: I’ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to
our conversation.
Rachel: Oh God.
Mr. Zelner: If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby…I am
sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not
mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I
understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
Rachel: Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
[Scene: A Street, Phoebe and Monica are walking down it.]
Phoebe: Oh there it is.
Monica: That’s not your regular dry cleaners.
Phoebe: I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I
have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult
bookstore, a new grocery store…
Monica: What?!
Phoebe: A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy
and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick
some ass.
Monica: Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a
great guy, so can you.
Phoebe: Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
(They enter the dry cleaners.)
Phoebe: Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.
Monica: Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland
for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She
points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
Phoebe: Okay.
(A guy enters that looks suspiciously like Alec Baldwin from The Hunt for Red
October, Pearl Harbor, and Beetlejuice.)
Guy: (To Phoebe) Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s…(looks at Phoebe.)
Wow!
Phoebe: What?
Guy: I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re so incredibly beautiful.
Phoebe: Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to
do?
Guy: I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant to
pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
Phoebe: A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now
you’re talking.
Guy: Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
Phoebe: I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Monica: (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Phoebe: (looking around) She must’ve left.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is watching Joey pace nervously as Rachel
enters.]
Rachel: Hi.
Joey: So? What-what-what happened?
Rachel: It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m
not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I
understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other
child I should bear.
Chandler: Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show
they’re not in the baby buying business.
Rachel: Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Chandler: Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
Rachel: Yeah.
Chandler: I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Rachel: Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to
make things…
Joey: I know. I know.
Rachel: It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I
haven’t thought about our thing since all this.
Joey: Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little
bit.
Rachel: Yeah I know! I miss that.
Joey: Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself
out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me
and-and how it was really awkward.
(Awkward silence.)
Rachel: My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Closing Credits
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross is ordering something over the phone from a catalog.]
Ross: (on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There’s a knock on the
door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
(She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s
just that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)
Mona: (interrupting him) Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I
understand why you were there.
Ross: You do?
Mona: Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have
feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t. It’s
too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant
to be.
Ross: (faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right.
Mona: Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go. (She picks
up the shirt Ross has just set down.) Can I? To remember you?
Ross: (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)

Host: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a
nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and
these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.

Joey: Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the
counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!

Mike: And there is Kevin.
[Cut forward.]

Mike: This is the first time he’s ever used this product, he's never used this
product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (To Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin'
starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you
don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.

to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
(The crowd ahhs.)

of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But
I won’t have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell your

Ross: (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's

The Interviewer: A mento…
Joey: Right.
The Interviewer: Like the candy?
Joey: Matter of fact, I do.
(Chandler tries to jump over the couch but everyone stops him.)

our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
Joey: Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
[Another set of flashbacks begin with Episode 521: The One With The Ball, Joey and Ross

doctor!

Joey: No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything

Chandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.)
Damn you 15s!

scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then
beef saut�ed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then
a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
[Time lapse, Ross and Joey are eating Rachel’s disaster.]

Joey.)
Joey: I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.
The Interviewer: Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years
ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
Joey: It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t
have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.

Ross: I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little
holiday weight.
(Ross continues to climb down. He puts his other foot further down on Joey’s
torso, but that doesn’t work very well and he’s forced to wrap his legs around
Joey. Which then forces Joey to get a nice and close view of Ross’s crotch.)

Chandler: Oh my God, introduce us!
Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
Jill: Hi!
Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
Ross: Hi Jill.
Rachel: And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey.
Joey: Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?
Rachel: Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)
[The final one is from Episode 607: The One Where Phoebe Runs, Joey has been trying to
repel Janice and sees it’s not working to his liking so he’s confronting her
about the sexual tension.]
Janine: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate
and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine: I don't think so.
Joey: Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
Janine: I'm okay.
Joey: What?!?! Oh dear God!
[Cut to the interview.]
Joey: Not much to tell there I’m really shy.
(The gang is confused.)
The Interviewer: So, that’s it. I guess that’s all I need. Thank you
so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Joey: Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)
The Interviewer: Bye.
Joey: Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the
gang.) I did it!
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Amazing! Amazing!
The Interviewer: (returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody
this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what’s your favorite soap opera?
Joey: Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?
(The gang is disappointed.)
The Interviewer: Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be
happy to hear that.
Joey: Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!
Closing Credits
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, everyone is reading Joey’s interview.]
Rachel: Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you
said you didn’t watch soap operas.
Joey: Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was
pretty nice about that.
Monica: You slept with her didn’t you?
Joey: Little bit, yeah.
Ross: Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Joey: Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
(Winks at him.)
Ross: Did you just wink at me?
Joey: Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture.
EndRoss: Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what 
happened here last night?
Chandler: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like 
you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what 
they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Ross: OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Chandler: No!
Ross: OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from 
her office out on your balcony.
Chandler: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica 
we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, 
nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they 
will"
Ross: Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel 
kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
Chandler: So are you gonna...talk to her?
Ross: Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's 
fine!
Chandler: You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it 
and spits!
Ross: No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care 
but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life 
on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing 
guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! 
Ah!
Chandler: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where 
you're moving?
Ross: I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now 
there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other 
day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Chandler: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Ross: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who 
totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
Chandler: Why did I get married?!
 
 
[Opening Credits]
 
[Scene: Central Perk]
Joey: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken 
tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows 
waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Phoebe: Well it depends.
Joey: On...?
Phoebe: On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Monica: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do 
something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows 
are...
Joey: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Phoebe: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Joey: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Phoebe: Wow! Talking about high maintenance
Joey: Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Phoebe: I'm a woman!
Joey: Arghhh! Double standards!
Phoebe: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar 
tonight?
Monica: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Phoebe: But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable 
old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone 
booed him off the stage. So funny.
Monica: It's just, I'm not good at singing.
Phoebe: Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better 
singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Monica: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Phoebe: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to 
sing.
Monica: So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass 
judgments on others?
Phoebe: While drinking...
Monica: I'm there!
Rachel: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something 
really stupid.
Phoebe: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out 
there
Rachel: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Phoebe: Oh my god.
Monica: You kissed him?
Rachel: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony 
and...
Monica: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed 
that?
Phoebe: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping 
paper.
Monica: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Rachel: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me 
and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Monica: I thought you hated him?
Rachel: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and 
it turns out that line...is a scarf!
Monica: So are you thinking of starting up something with this 
guy?
Rachel: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you 
know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do 
and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
Monica: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, 
and you definitely should talk to Ross
Rachel: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Phoebe: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss 
a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
 
[Scene: Beauty salon]
Salon girl: Hi
Joey: Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Salon girl: Name?
Joey: Chandler Bing.
Salon girl: Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia 
will be right with you.
Joey: OK Thanks.(Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the 
stuff
Sonia: I'll take care of it
Joey: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Sonia: Oh absolutely.
Joey: Oh good...
Sonia: Are you looking to meet somebody?
Joey: All right let's just do this.
Sonia: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of 
the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...
Joey: Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My 
face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock 
that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK(He tries to avoid the 
tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
[Scene: Central Perk]
Chandler: Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on 
going?
Ross: Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand 
but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Chandler: Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I 
mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two 
illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
Ross: That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Chandler: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Ross: I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to 
me
Chandler: Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just 
an impulsive one-time birthday thing
Ross: No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a 
bar.
Chandler: Did she go out with him?
Ross: No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Chandler: Ah! The high road...
Ross: You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey 
check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
Chandler: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Ross: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the 
two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of 
jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some 
interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, 
sexy one...
Chandler: I thought I had to make the jokes!
Ross: Don't you have to be at work?
Chandler: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend 
Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only 
need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
Ross: Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the 
paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: "Would you...would you 
rather drown or be burnt alive?"
Blonde girl: Sorry...we were just leaving
Chandler: We still got it!
 
[Scene: Ross']
 
Rachel: Who is it?
Gavin: Gavin! I brought you some soup.
Rachel: Why?
Gavin: I heard you were sick...
Rachel: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little 
bit! Hello Gavin
Gavin: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
Rachel: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick
Gavin: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I 
thought you called in sick to avoid me.
Rachel: Oh no no no
Gavin: So I had fun last night
Rachel: So did I
Gavin: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold 
for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
Rachel: It's just a cold
Gavin: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
Rachel: What? What's the matter?
Gavin: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
Rachel: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be 
funny.
Gavin: Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want 
to get in the middle of anything
Rachel: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, 
don't worry about Ross really, really.(She hears the noise of the key in the 
lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
Gavin: Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
Rachel: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Molly: Hi!
Rachel: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Molly: No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
Rachel: Right, right, yes!
Molly: Don't panic!
Rachel: What?
Molly: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my 
purse.
Rachel: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my 
business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind 
that curtain!
Gavin: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand 
there.
Molly: Hello! I just go and get Emma.
Rachel: OK.
Gavin: So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Rachel: I thought it was Ross.
Gavin: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between 
you two...
Rachel: There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Gavin: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming 
out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.
Rachel: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were 
here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship 
but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus 
there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, 
I'm just all over the place.
Gavin: It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a 
piece of advice?
Rachel: Yes
Gavin: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
Rachel: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
Gavin: Don't be. It's just bad timing.
Rachel: So seriously...rodeo clown?
Gavin: One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
 
[Scene: Mike's piano bar]
 
Phoebe: "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the 
world...!" Thank you!
(Mike kisses Phoebe)
Mike: Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to 
get a break and when we come back we've got Kennethsinging "I touch 
myself"...I'm not here to judge!
Phoebe: Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Monica: No I told you I can't.
Phoebe: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice 
voice.
Monica: What have you heard me sing?
Phoebe: All the time when you're cooking.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in 
my tummy"
Monica: Yeah I do rock that one.
Phoebe: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up 
there?
Monica: Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I 
would sing...
Mike: Well I've got a book around...
Monica: "Delta Dawn"
 
[Scene: Central Perk]
 
Ross: Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace
Woman: You already hit on me an hour ago
Ross: Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep 
striking out.
Chandler: I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, 
you're asking women how they want to be killed
Ross: This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the 
one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Chandler: By drowning or...?!
Michelle: Why would he break up with me?
Her friend: I don't know sweetie.
Michelle: All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. 
I mean, am I so unlovable?
Chandler: Well...
Ross: I know! (he stands)
 
 
[Scene: Piano bar]
 
Mike: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of 
"I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monicasinging "Delta 
Dawn".
Monica: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Phoebe: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that 
spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
Monica: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta 
Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone 
by? ..."
Phoebe: Can you totally see through her shirt ?
Mike: Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
Monica: "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
 
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]
 
Joey: Hey, I need your help.
Chandler: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley 
Judd?
Joey: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my 
eyebrows shaped
Chandler: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Joey: You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All 
right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they 
don�t match!
Chandler: It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Joey: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic 
marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don�t look stupid for my 
pictures.
Chandler: Ok. First of all, this is green!
Joey: What the hell am I supposed to do!
Chandler: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you 
will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Joey: What, what.
Chandler: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the 
lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows 
of my father and his �business� partners.
Joey: Oh my God!
Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor 
Victoria!
Joey: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, 
but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so 
bad!
Chandler: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my 
gentle self-loathing touch.
 
[Scene: Piano Bar]
 
Monica: "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is 
over. Did you see me out there?
Phoebe: Every little bit of you!
Monica: I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the 
people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting �look at those 
tips�! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Mike: Sure.
Phoebe: Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...
Monica: Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for 
making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.
Mike: Also a good gift? Underwear.
 
[Scene: Ross']
 
Michelle: Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms 
freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else.
Ross: But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
Michelle: It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with 
me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.
Ross: Uh-ah!
Michelle: No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally 
over Eric.
Ross: (pfew). Good choice Ross.
Rachel: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you 
everywhere!
Ross: Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
Rachel: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. 
So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk� somebody 
here?
Ross: Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle.
Rachel: Who?
Ross: Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.
Rachel: You�ve being seeing someone?
Ross: Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going 
out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I 
mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it 
wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
Michelle: What are you taking amoxicillin for?
Ross: How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look 
through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�smy roommate, Rachel.
Rachel: Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother.
Michelle: Ah, who is Emma?
Ross: I told you about my daughter.
Michelle: This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
 
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]
 
Chandler: And done!
Joey: Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a 
job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the 
saloon
Chandler: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look 
great! How you doing!
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little 
worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to 
be a little piece of chocolate.
Joey: Thank you so much.
Chandler: No problem.
Joey: Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some 
manly make up for it.
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Comb my eyelashes.
 
[Scene: Piano Bar]
 
Monica: Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more 
upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters �I am so excited�. And 
make it bouncy!
Phoebe: Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
Chandler: I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see 
Joey.
Monica: Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another 
song!
Chandler: Really? In front of all this people?
Monica: And they love me!
Chandler: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yes, she gives the people what they want.
Monica: All right, watch!
Monica: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll 
put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some 
affection..."
Chandler: Are those my wife�s nipples?
Phoebe: Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have 
let her go up again.
Chandler: I gotta stop this.
Monica: Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
Chandler: You, touching yourself, out!
 
[Scene: Ross�]
 
Rachel: Wow. She does that a lot!
Michelle: Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!
Rachel: What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a 
doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
Michelle: Actually about an hour and a half.
Ross: I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection 
between us.
Michelle: You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
Ross: Are you kidding?
Michelle: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
Ross: We�ll see.
Rachel: Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange 
women back to the apartment now?
Ross: I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Rachel: How do you know about that?
Ross: Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to 
sleep...
Michelle: Emma.
Ross: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a 
guy you know, for what? A week?
Rachel: Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to 
get back at me?
Michelle: No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public 
bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
Ross: Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.
Michelle: Well, call me!
Ross: Ok.
Michelle: No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!
Ross: You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye.
Rachel: Score.
Ross: Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we 
could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
Rachel: Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. 
It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
Ross: Oh, really!
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Oh, really!
Rachel: Oh yeah.
Ross: What about the guy from the bar?
Rachel: What? Who?
Ross: The guy you gave your number to.
Rachel: Whoa, how do you know about that?
Ross: Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me 
this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You�ve been 
out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn�t even 
have the courtesy to tell me.
Rachel: Why didn�t I get that message?
Ross: What?
Rachel: From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?
Ross: Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you 
not look there?
Rachel: Ross?
Ross: I never gave it to you.
Rachel: Why?
Ross: I don�t know.
Rachel: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to 
decide what messages I should or should not get?
Ross: Who am I?
Rachel: Yes.
Ross: I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars 
meeting guys!
Rachel: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in 
here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can�t do 
that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my 
apartment!
Ross: None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the 
point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn�t tell 
anyone!
Rachel: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You 
know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, �what, you live 
together but you�re not a couple? And you have a baby, isn�t that weird?� And I 
say �No.You know what, it�s not, because it works for us!� But you know this 
doesn�t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!
Ross: Uh, clearly.
Rachel: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as 
long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn�t make sense 
anymore.
Ross: Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
 
[Scene: Joey's]
 
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Joey: Ha, oh, of course.
Rachel: Thank you.
Joey: Your eyebrows look weird.
